title: Unstructured Business dedicated instance on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with PrivateLink - onboarding
sidebarTitle: Dedicated instance + PrivateLink onboarding
---

<Note>
    The following information applies only to dedicated instance deployments with PrivateLink for [Unstructured Business](/business/overview) on AWS. 

    For dedicated instance deployments of Unstructured Business to AWS _without_ PrivateLink, contact your Unstructured sales representative, 
    or email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).

    For in-VPC deployments of Unstructured Business to AWS instead, see the [AWS in-VPC onboarding](/business/aws/onboard) checklist.
</Note>

After your organization has signed the **Business** account agreement with Unstructured, a member of the Unstructured technical enablement team will reach out to you to begin the 
deployment onboarding process. While you wait, you can get started by following the onboarding process:

1. Provide your Unstructured sales representative or technical enablement contact with the AWS Region name 
   where you want the dedicated instance deployment to be created. Unstructured will begin creating the dedicated instance deployment in that AWS Region.

   <Note>
       If you do not know who your Unstructured sales representative or technical enablement contact is, 
       email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io), and a member of the Unstructured sales or technical enablement teams 
       will get back to you as soon as possible.
   </Note>

   Unstructured supports only the following AWS Regions for dedicated instance deployments:

   | Name | Code |
   | --- | --- |
   | `us-east-1` | US East (N. Virginia) |
   | `us-east-2` | US East(Ohio) |
   | `us-west-2` | US West(Oregon) |
   | `eu-west-1` | Europoe (Ireland) |
   | `eu-north-1` | Europe (Stockholm) |
   | `eu-central-1` | Europe (Frankfurt) |
   | `ap-southeast-2` | Asia Pacific (Sydney) |
   | `ap-south-1` | Asia Pacific (Mumbai) |
   | `ap-northeast-2` |Asia Pacific (Seoul) |

2. In your AWS account, create an endpoint service powered by AWS PrivateLink. Be sure when creating the endpoint service to use the same AWS Region name that you provided to Unstructured. 
   [Learn how](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/create-endpoint-service.html). (In AWS terminology, this makes you the _service provider_ and 
   Unstructured the _service consumer_.)
3. As the service provider, you must provide your Unstructured sales representative or technical enablement contact (as the service consumer) with the name of your endpoint service 
   (for example, `com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0e123abc123198abc`) and the supported Availability Zones for that endpoint service, for the AWS Region 
   name that you provided to Unstructured earlier. [Learn how](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/create-endpoint-service.html#share-endpoint-service).
4. As the service consumer, Unstructured will create a related endpoint service in its own AWS account in the same AWS Region as your AWS account. Unstructured will then send you an endpoint connection request to 
   complete the connection between its endpoint service (as the service consumer) and your endpoint service (as the service provider). 
   You must accept Unstructured's endpoint connection request as soon as possible, to avoid delays in the deployment process. 
   [Learn how](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/configure-endpoint-service.html#accept-reject-connection-requests).
