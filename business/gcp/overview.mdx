## Getting started

To get started with a **Business** account deployment, your organization must first sign a **Business** account agreement with Unstructured. 
This agreement outlines the terms and conditions for your organization to use Unstructured in a **Business** account environment.

To begin the **Business** account agreement process, contact your Unstructured sales representative, or email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).

After your organization has signed the **Business** account agreement, a member of the Unstructured technical enablement team will reach out to you to begin the 
deployment onboarding process. To streamline this process, you are encouraged to begin setting up your target environment as soon as possible. To do this, 
see the [onboarding checkist](/business/gcp/onboard).
