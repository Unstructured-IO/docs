<Note>
    The following information applies only to dedicated instance and in-VPC deployments of [Unstructured Business](/business/overview). 

    IdP integration is not available for Unstructured **Let's Go**, **Pay-As-You-Go**, or **Business SaaS** accounts.
</Note>

The following information assumes that Unstructured has already connected your organization's IdP to your Unstructured account. 
For more information, see [Getting started](/business/idp/overview#getting-started).

## Add an IdP group to an organizational account

1. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your Unstructured account.
2. In the top navigation bar, in the organizational account selector, select the name of the organizational account that you want to add the IdP group to.
3. In the sidebar, above your user icon, click the **Settings** (gear) icon, and then click **Manage Account**.
4. In the top navigation bar, click **IdP Groups**.
5. Click **+ New Group**.
6. On the **Connect Group** page, for **Identity Provider Group**, type the name of the IdP group that you want to add, and then click **Continue**.

   <Note>
       You must type the name of the IdP group exactly as it appears in your IdP. Otherwise, Unstructured will not be able to 
       successfully complete the connection to that IdP group through your IdP.
   </Note>

7. On the **Assign Account Role** page, for **Account Role**, select the name of the [organizational account role](/ui/account/roles#organizational-account-roles) that you want to assign to the IdP group for this 
   organizational account, and then click **Continue**.
8. On the **Assign Workspaces** page, for **Workspaces and permissions**, select each workspace&mdash;and the 
   [workspace role](/ui/account/roles#workspace-roles) for that workspace&mdash;that you want to assign to the IdP group, and then click **Add**.

   <Note>
       The **Assign Workspaces** page does not apply if the IdP group is assigned the **Super Administrator** organizational account role. 
       This is because an IdP group with the **Super Administrator** role automatically has full access to all of the organizational account's workspaces. 
   </Note>

9. Click **Save Group**.

The organizational account and workspaces' roles' permissions are enabled for each of the IdP group's existing users the first (or next) time they sign in to your Unstructured account and then choose 
this organizational account.

Whenever you add a user to the IdP group, they get the associated account and workspace roles' permissions the next time they 
sign in to your Unstructured account and then choose this organizational account. 

If a user is already signed in to your Unstructured account and has chosen this organizational account, but they are not getting the permissions they expect, the user should try signing out of your Unstructured account and then signing back in and choosing this organizational account again, to get those permissions. 

If you remove a user from the IdP group, the associated account and workspace roles' permissions are revoked for them the next time they sign in to your Unstructured account and then choose this organizational account. An exception to this is if the user was otherwise [added as an individual user to the account](#add-individual-users-to-an-account).

## Add individual users to an account

Unstructured recommends that you add IdP groups to an organizational account, instead of adding individual users. 
Managing IdP groups can be easier, faster, and less error-prone than managing individual users. 
However, if you must add individual users to an organizational account (for example, if you want to give a user 
access to an organizational account at a different level than the access that is granted to them through their IdP groups), 
you can do so by following these steps.

1. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your Unstructured account.
2. In the top navigation bar, in the organizational account selector, select the name of the organizational account.
3. In the sidebar, above your user icon, click the **Settings** (gear) icon, and then click **Manage Account**.
3. On the **Members** tab, click **New Member +**.
4. On the **Add New Member** page, for **Email**, type the email address of each individual user to add.
5. For all of the email addresses that you typed, select the [organizational account role](/ui/account/roles#organizational-account-roles) for all of the individual users at once, and then click **Continue**.

   <Warning>
       An organizational account role that is assigned to an individual user always overrides any organizational account role that is assigned to any IdP group to which that user belongs. 
       This override happens the next time they sign in to your Unstructured account and then choose this organizational account.
   </Warning>

6. Click **Continue**.

## Add individual users to a workspace

Unstructured recommends that you add IdP groups to your workspaces, instead of adding individual users. 
Managing IdP groups can be easier, faster, and less error-prone than managing individual users. 
However, if you must add individual users to workspaces (for example, if you want to give a user 
access to a workspace at a different level than the access than is granted to them through their IdP groups), 
you can do so by following these steps.

2. In the top navigation bar, in the organizational account selector, select the name of the organizational account that contains the workspace for the individual users you want to add.

   </Note>

5. On the **Add New Member** page, for **Email**, type the email address of each individual user to add.
6. For all of the email addresses that you typed, select the [workspace role](/ui/account/roles#workspace-roles) for all of the individual users at once, and then click **Continue**.

   <Warning>
       A workspace role that is assigned to an individual user always overrides any workspace role that is assigned to any IdP group to which that user belongs. 
       This override happens the next time they sign in to your Unstructured account and then choose this organizational account.
   </Warning>

7. Click **Continue**.
