---

To access the dedicated instance over Azure Private Link, you must configure DNS so the service hostname resolves to your 
private endpoint's private IP address.

Because TLS is terminated using a provider-managed certificate, clients must connect using the exact service hostname provided. 
However, DNS resolution must direct that hostname to a private IP inside your network, as follows:

1. Create or select a private DNS zone: create a private DNS zone that matches the service hostname, or use an existing private zone.
    
   For example, if the service hostname is `example.privatelink.unstructuredapp.io`, the private DNS zone would be 
   `privatelink.unstructuredapp.io`.

2. Add a DNS record for the service hostname: create an A record for the full service hostname that points to the private IP address 
   of your private endpoint.

   For example, `example.privatelink.unstructuredapp.io` would point to `10.12.34.56`.

3. Link the DNS zone to your Azure Virtual Networks (VNets): ensure the private DNS zone is linked to the VNets where clients will access the service.
