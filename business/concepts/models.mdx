<Note>
    The following information applies only to dedicated instance and in-VPC deployments of [Unstructured Business](/business/overview). 
</Note>

For Unstructured Business dedicated instance and in-VPC deployments, Unstructured requires that you complete special 
model configuration steps before you can use any ofthe following features in your Unstructured account:

- [Partitioning](/ui/partitioning) that uses the **VLM** strategy, or the **Auto** strategy whenever it routes documents or pages to the **VLM** strategy
- [Enrichments](/ui/enriching/overview)
- [Embedding](/ui/embedding)

Each of these features rely on models that you provide information to Unstructured about. For example, when you have 
Unstructured generate embeddings, you must have already configured your Unstructured account with the model's identifier, the model 
provider's API key for your account with that provider, and any other miscellaneous settings that the model's provider might also require.

You must already have an account with the provider of each model that you configure your Unstructured account to use. 
Whenever Unstructured uses one of these models, its usage is billed directly to your account with the model's provider. 
These third-party charges are not included in your Unstructured account's bill. You are responsible for paying 
these third-party bills separately from your Unstructured Business account's bills. If you do not pay these third-party bills 
in a timely manner, these Unstructured features might stop working as expected at any time and without any prior notice.

<Tip>
    The following steps do not apply to **Let's Go**, **Pay-As-You-Go**, or **Business SaaS** accounts. 
    This is because the costs for using the models that Unstructured provides are already factored into the 
    pricing models for these account types.

    For Unstructured Business dedicated instance and in-VPC deployments, completing the following steps enables you to 
    better manage and reduce your overall costs by negotiating lower overall billing rates with Unstructured for its core features, while also 
    leveraging any separately negotiated volume discounts with the model providers that you want to use.
</Tip>

## Add a model to an account

To have Unstructured use a model, you must first add the model to your Unstructured account, as follows. This procedure 
assumes that you have already created an account with the model's provider, generated an API key for your account 
with that provider, and obtained any other miscellaneous settings that the model's provider might also require. For 
more information, see the model's provider's documentation.

1. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your Unstructured account.
2. On the sidebar, click your user icon, and then click **Account Settings**.
3. In the top navigation bar, click the **Models** tab.
4. ...

After you add the model, you must enable it for each Unstructured workspace that wants to use it. 
[Learn how](#enable-a-model-for-a-workspace).

## Enable a model for a workspace

This procedure assumes that you have already added the model to your Unstructured account. [Learn how](#add-a-model-to-an-account).

1. 1. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your Unstructured account.
2. On the sidebar, click your user icon, and then click **Account Settings**.
3. In the top navigation bar, click the **Models** tab.
4. ...

## Update the settings for a model

After you [add a model](#add-a-model-to-an-account) to your Unstructured account, you can no longer that model's 
settings screen to change it. This is by design to prevent users from 
accessing sensitive API key strings or other sensitive settings that they might not otherwise be allowed 
to access across your organization.

To update the settings for a model, do the following:

2. [Add a new collection of settings for the same model](#add-a-model-to-an-account) to your account.
3. [Enable the new collection of settings](#enable-a-model-for-a-workspace) for each Unstructured workspace that wants to use it.
1. [Delete the old model's settings](#delete-a-model) from your Unstructured account.
