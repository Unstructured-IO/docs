<Note>
    The following information applies only to dedicated instance and in-VPC deployments of [Unstructured Business](/business/overview). 
</Note>

For Unstructured Business dedicated instance and in-VPC deployments, Unstructured requires that you complete special 
AI provider configuration steps before you can use any ofthe following features in your Unstructured account:

- [Partitioning](/ui/partitioning) that uses the **VLM** strategy, or the **Auto** strategy whenever it routes documents or pages to the **VLM** strategy
- [Enrichments](/ui/enriching/overview)
- [Embedding](/ui/embedding)

Each of these features rely on AI models by AI providers that you give information to Unstructured about. For example, when you have 
Unstructured generate embeddings, you must have already configured your Unstructured account with the corresponding AI 
provider's API key for your account with that provider, and any other miscellaneous settings that the provider might also require.

You must already have an account with the AI provider of each model that you configure your Unstructured account to use. 
Whenever Unstructured uses one of these models, its usage is billed directly to your account with the model's provider. 
These third-party charges are not included in your Unstructured account's bill. You are responsible for paying 
these third-party bills separately from your Unstructured Business account's bills. If you do not pay these third-party bills 
in a timely manner, these Unstructured features might stop working as expected at any time and without any prior notice.

<Tip>
    The following steps do not apply to **Let's Go**, **Pay-As-You-Go**, or **Business SaaS** accounts. 
    This is because the costs for using the models that Unstructured provides are already factored into the 
    pricing structures for these account types.

    For Unstructured Business dedicated instance and in-VPC deployments, completing the following steps enables you to 
    better manage and reduce your overall costs by negotiating lower overall billing rates with Unstructured for its core features, while also 
    leveraging any separately negotiated volume discounts with the AI providers that you want to use.
</Tip>

## Enable a provider in your account

To have Unstructured use an AI model, you must first enable the model's AI provider in your Unstructured account, as follows. This procedure 
assumes that you have already created an account with the model's provider, generated an API key for your account 
with that provider, and obtained any other miscellaneous settings that the provider might also require. For 
more information, see the provider's documentation.

To enable a provider in your Unstructured account, do the following:

1. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your Unstructured account.
2. In the top navigation bar, in the organizational account selector, select the name of the organizational account to which you want to add the model.
3. On the sidebar, click your user icon, and then click **Account Settings**.
4. In the top navigation bar, click the **AI Providers** tab.
5. In the list of available providers, next to the target provider's name, click **Configure**.
6. In the **Configure AI Provider** dialog, enter your API key for the provider, along with any other 
   miscellaneous settings that the provider might also require.
7. In the **Workspaces** drop-down list, select the workspaces that you want to enable the provider for.
8. Click **Save Configuration**.

## Change the enabled providers for a workspace

This procedure assumes that you have already enabled the AI provider in your Unstructured account. [Learn how](#enable-a-provider-in-your-account).

When you [enable a provider in your Unstructured account](##enable-a-provider-in-your-account), you have an initial opportunity to 
enable it for each Unstructured workspace that wants to use it.

To change the list of providers that were previously enabled for a workspace, do the following:

1. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your Unstructured account.
2. In the top navigation bar, in the organizational account selector, select the name of the organizational account that you want to add the model to.
3. On the sidebar, click your user icon, and then click **Account Settings**.
4. In the top navigation bar, click the **AI Providers** tab.
5. In the list of available workspaces, next to the workspace for which you want to change the enabled providers for, 
   turn on or off the toggle for each provider that you want to enable or disable for that workspace, respectively.

## Update the settings for a provider

After you [enable a provider in your Unstructured account](##enable-a-provider-in-your-account), you can no longer open that provider's 
settings screen to make any changes to it. This is by design to prevent users from 
accessing sensitive API key strings or other sensitive settings that they might not otherwise be allowed 
to access across your organization.

To update the settings for a provider, do the following:

1. [Add a new collection of settings for the same provider](#enable-a-provider-in-your-account) in your Unstructured account.
2. [Disable the old provider](#delete-a-model) in your Unstructured account.
