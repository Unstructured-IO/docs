Unstructured offers _business_ deployments, which allow you to use an Unstructured **Business** account to run the [Unstructured user interface](/ui/overview) (UI) 
and the [Unstructured API](/api-reference/overview) as follows:

- <Icon icon="people-group" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a **Business SaaS** deployment - Hosted alongside other accounts on Unstructured's cloud infrastructure.
- <Icon icon="shield-halved" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a **dedicated instance** deployment - Hosted within a virtual private cloud (VPC) running inside Unstructured's cloud infrastructure. Dedicated instances are isolated from all other accounts, for additional security and control.
- <Icon icon="shield" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Within an **in-VPC** deployment - Hosted within your own VPC on your own cloud infrastructure.

Unstructured **Business** accounts allow for multiple users and offer multiple workspaces. The **dedicated instance** and **in-VPC** account deployment types isolate your Unstructured **Business** account 
from all other Unstructured accounts. **Business** account deployments also allow for robust customization of Unstructured's features for your unique needs.

- To sign up for Unstructured **Business**, [contact Unstructured Sales](https://unstructured.io/?modal=contact-sales).
- To switch from an existing Unstructured **Let's Go** or **Pay-As-You-Go** account to **Business**, email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).

Unstructured **Business** deployments provide benefits such as the following:

- _Security, privacy, and ownership_: Your organization might have strict data security requirements to keep your data and models within a virtual private cloud (VPC).
- _Compliance and data sovereignty_: Certain industries and locales might have regulatory requirements that require data to be processed and for data and models to be stored in specific cloud provider regions.
- _Customization_: **Business** account deployments allow for more customization and control options over your environments.
- _Testing and development_: **Business** account deployments can be useful for multi-environment testing and development purposes, allowing you to experiment with Unstructured in a testing environment without affecting your production environment.

## Getting started

To get started with a **Business** account deployment, your organization must first sign a **Business** account agreement with Unstructured. 
This agreement outlines the terms and conditions for your organization's use of Unstructured.

To begin the **Business** account agreement process, contact your Unstructured sales representative, or email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).

After your organization has signed the **Business** account agreement, the next steps are as follows:

- For a **Business SaaS** deployment, you can start using Unstructured by logging in to the Unstructured UI at [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io).
- For a **dedicated instance** deployment, a member of the Unstructured technical enablement team will reach out to you with the unique URL to log in to 
  the Unstructured UI, along with any next steps that you need to take. For dedicated instance deployments to AWS that also use PrivateLink, see 
  the [onboarding process for AWS PrivateLink](/business/aws/dedicated-instance-privatelink).
- For an **in-VPC** deployment, your organization will work with a member of the Unstructured technical enablement team to deploy Unstructured 
  into your own cloud instrastructure. You are encouraged to begin setting up your target environment as soon as possible. To do this, 
  see the onboarding requirements for your [AWS](/business/aws/onboard), [Azure](/business/azure/onboard), or  
  [GCP](/business/gcp/onboard) account.
