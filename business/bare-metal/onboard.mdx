<Note>
    The following information applies only to bare metal deployments of [Unstructured Enterprise](/business/overview). 

    For dedicated instance or in-VPC deployments of Unstructured Enterprise, contact your Unstructured sales representative, 
    or email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).
</Note>

After your organization has signed the bare metal agreement with Unstructured, a member of the Unstructured technical enablement team will reach out to you to begin the 
deployment onboarding process. To streamline this process, you are encouraged to begin setting up your target environment as soon as possible. To do this, you 
must first set up your hardware as follows.

## Questions? Need help?

If you have questions or need help as you go, contact your Unstructured sales representative or technical enablement contact. If you do not know who they are, 
email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io), and a member of the Unstructured sales or technical enablement teams 
will get back to you as soon as possible.
