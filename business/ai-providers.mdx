<Note>
    The following information applies only to **dedicated instance** and **in-VPC** deployments of [Unstructured Business](/business/overview). 
</Note>

For Unstructured Business **dedicated instance** and **in-VPC** deployments, Unstructured requires that you complete special 
AI provider configuration steps before you can use any of the following features in your Unstructured account:

- [Partitioning](/ui/partitioning) that uses the **VLM** strategy, or the **Auto** strategy whenever it routes documents or pages to the **VLM** strategy
- [Enrichments](/ui/enriching/overview)
- [Structured data extraction](/ui/data-extractor)
- [Embedding](/ui/embedding)

Each of these features rely on AI models by AI providers that you give information to Unstructured about. For example, when you have 
Unstructured generate embeddings, you must have already configured your Unstructured account with the corresponding AI 
provider's access credentials for your account with that AI provider, and any other miscellaneous settings that the AI provider might also require.

You must already have an account with the AI provider of each model that you configure your Unstructured account to use. 
Whenever Unstructured uses one of these models, its usage is billed directly to your account with the model's AI provider. 
These third-party charges are not included in your Unstructured account's bill. You are responsible for paying 
these third-party bills separately from your Unstructured account's bills. If you do not pay these third-party bills 
in a timely manner, these Unstructured features might stop working as expected at any time and without any prior notice.

<Tip>
    The following steps do not apply to **Let's Go**, **Pay-As-You-Go**, or **Business SaaS** accounts. 
    This is because the costs for using the models that Unstructured provides are already factored into the 
    pricing structures for these account types.

    For Unstructured Business **dedicated instance** and **in-VPC** deployments, completing the following steps enables you to 
    better manage and reduce your overall costs by negotiating lower overall billing rates with Unstructured for its core features, while also 
    leveraging any separately negotiated volume discounts with the AI providers that you want to use.

## Configure an AI provider

To have Unstructured use an AI model, you must first configure the model's AI provider for each target Unstructured 
[workspace](/ui/account/workspaces) within each corresponding Unstructured [organizational account](/ui/account/organizations) in 
your **dedicated instance** or **in-VPC** deployment, as follows.

This procedure assumes that you have already created an account with the model's AI provider, generated access credentials for your account 
with that AI provider, and obtained any other miscellaneous settings that the AI provider might also require. For 
more information, see the AI provider's documentation.

To configure an AI provider for a workspace, do the following:

1. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your Unstructured account.
2. In the top navigation bar, in the organizational account selector, select the name of the organizational account to which  the target workspace belongs.
3. Next to the organizational account selector, click the workspace selector, and then select the name of the target workspace.
4. In the workspace navigation bar, click the **AI Providers** tab.
5. In the list of available AI providers, next to the target AI provider's name, click **Configure**.
6. In the **Configure AI Provider** dialog, enter your access credentials for the AI provider, along with any other 
   miscellaneous settings that the AI provider might also require. To get these settings, see your AI provider's documentation.
7. Click **Save Configuration**.

The configured AI provider is now ready to be used by all workflows in this workspace.

## Update an AI provider's configuration

After you [configure an AI provider](#configure-an-ai-provider), you can no longer open that AI provider's 
settings screen to make any changes to it. This is by design to prevent users from 
accessing sensitive access credentials strings or other sensitive settings that they might not otherwise be allowed 
to access across your organization.

To update the settings for an AI provider, do the following:

1. [Delete the target AI provider's current configuration](#delete-an-ai-provider's-configuration).
2. [Configure the target AI provider again](#configure-an-ai-provider).

## Delete an AI provider's configuration

<Warning>
    After you delete an AI provider's configuration, any workflows in the selected workspace that rely on this AI provider 
    might produce unexpected results or stop working altogether.
</Warning>

To delete an AI provider's configuration, do the following:

1. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your Unstructured account.
2. In the top navigation bar, in the organizational account selector, select the name of the organizational account to which  
   the workspace with the target AI provider's configuration belongs.
3. Next to the organizational account selector, click the workspace selector, and then select the name of the target workspace.
4. In the workspace navigation bar, click the **AI Providers** tab.
5. In the list of AI providers, next to the target AI provider's name, click the ellipsis (three dots) icon.
6. Click **Delete Configuration**.
7. To confirm the deletion, click **Delete Configuration**.

You can [configure the target AI provider again](#configure-an-ai-provider) at any time.

## No API support for AI provider management

You cannot use the Unstructured API to manage AI providers. You can manage AI providers only through the Unstructured UI.
