### <Icon icon="computer" />   Quickstart: Unstructured Platform

<Info>If you want to use your local machine for either your source (input) files, or the destination (output) location for Unstructured to deliver the processed data, you cannot use this quickstart. You must run code on your local machine instead: skip to the [Quickstart: Unstructured Serverless API](#quickstart-serverless-api) or [Quickstart: Unstructured open source library](#quickstart-unstructured-open-source-library), later in this article.</Info>

import SharedPlatform from '/snippets/quickstarts/platform.mdx';
import AdditionalIngestDependencies from '/snippets/general-shared-text/ingest-dependencies.mdx';

### <Icon icon="square-terminal" />   Quickstart: Unstructured Serverless API

This quickstart uses your local machine, with the [Unstructured Python SDK](/api-reference/api-services/sdk-python) installed. It preprocess a single-file source (input) file on your local machine, and it uses the Unstructured Serverless API to deliver the processed data to a destination (output) location, also on your local machine. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

To get started even faster than following the steps below, simply sign up for a 14-day trial of the Unstructured Serverless API at [https://app.unstructured.io](https://app.unstructured.io), and then follow along with this 3-minute video:

  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

<Info>
    The Unstructured Python SDK (and the Unstructured JavaScript/TypeScript SDK) work with only a single file at a time and only with local source and destination locations. To process multiple files at a time, or to use non-local source or destination locations, use the [Unstructured Python Ingest CLI](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-cli) or the [Unstructured Ingest Python library](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-python-library) instead.
</Info>

You will need:

- Python installed on your local machine.
- A compatible file, such as a PDF file on your local machine to be processed. [See the list of supported file types](/api-reference/api-services/overview#supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Sign up">
        Sign up for a 14-day trial of the Unstructured Serverless API at [https://app.unstructured.io](https://app.unstructured.io).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Sign in">
        1. Enter your email address and then click **Sign In** to receive a magic link to sign in to your personalized dashboard, or authenticate yourself with your Google or GitHub account.
        2. Once you authenticate with the magic link or with your Google or GitHub account, your dashboard appears.
    </Step> 
    <Step title="Get your API key and API URL">
        1. On the sidebar, click **API Keys**, if it is not already selected.
        2. To get your API key, click the copy icon in the **Actions** column for your API key, and then click **Key Only**. Store your copied API key in a secure location. Do not share it with others.
        3. To get your API URL, click the copy icon next to the URL next to **API URL**. Store your copied API URL in a secure location. Do not share it with others.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set enviromnent variables">
        1. Set an environment variable named `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` to the value of your Unstructured API key.
        2. Set another environment variable named `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` to the value of your Unstructured API URL.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install the SDK">
        Run the following command:
        ```bash
        pip install unstructured-client
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the code">
        Run the following code, replacing:

        - `<path/to/input/file>` with the source (input) path on your local machine that contains the compatible file for Unstructured to process on its hosted compute resources.
        - `<path/to/output/file>` with the destination (output) path on your local machine that will contain the processed data that Unstructured returns from its hosted compute resources.

        <Tip>For the Unstructured Serverless API, you can set the `server` parameter to the string `saas-api` instead of setting `server_url` (Python) or `serverURL` (JavaScript/TypeScript) to your Unstructured Serverless API URL.</Tip>
    
        ```python
        import json, os

        from unstructured_client import UnstructuredClient
        from unstructured_client.models import operations, shared

        input_filepath = "<local/path/to/input/file>"
        output_filepath = "<local/path/to/output/file>"

        client = UnstructuredClient(
            api_key_auth=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"),
            server_url=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL")
        )

        with open(input_filepath, "rb") as f:
            files = shared.Files(
                content=f.read(),
                file_name=input_filepath
            )

        req = operations.PartitionRequest(
            shared.PartitionParameters(
                files=files,
                split_pdf_page=True,
                split_pdf_allow_failed=True,
                split_pdf_concurrency_level=15
            )
        )

        try:
            res = client.general.partition(request=req)
            element_dicts = [element for element in res.elements]
            json_elements = json.dumps(element_dicts, indent=2)
            
            # Print the processed data.
            print(json_elements)

            # Write the processed data to a local file.
            with open(output_filepath, "w") as file:
            file.write(json_elements)
        except Exception as e:
            print(e)
        ```
        </Step>
    <Step title="View the processed data">
        Go to your destination location to view the processed data.

### <Icon icon="door-open" />   Quickstart: Unstructured open source library

This quickstart uses your local machine for a single-file source (input) location, and a destination (output) location for the processed data. This quickstart also uses local data processing. It does not call Unstructured Serverless API services.

<Warning>
    The open source library is not designed for use in production. It is designed as a starting point for quick prototyping and is [limited](/open-source/introduction/overview#limits). For production scenarios, use the [Unstructured Platform](/platform/overview) and [Unstructured API services](/api-reference/api-services/overview).
</Warning>

<Info>
    The open source library is designed primarily to work with only a single file at a time and only with local source and destination locations. To process multiple files at a time, or to use non-local source or destination locations, use the [Unstructured Python Ingest CLI](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-cli) or the [Unstructured Ingest Python library](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-python-library) instead.    
</Info>

You will need:

- Python installed on your local machine.
- A compatible file on your local machine to be processed. [See the list of supported file types](/api-reference/api-services/overview#supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install the open source library">
        Run the following command:
        ```bash
        pip install "unstructured[all-docs]"
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the code">
        Run the following command, replacing:

        - `<path/to/input/file>` with the source (input) path on your local machine that contains the compatible file to process.
        - `<path/to/output/file>` with the destination (output) path on your local machine that will contain the processed data.

        ```python
        import json

        from unstructured.partition.auto import partition

        input_filepath = "<path/to/input/file>"
        output_filepath = "<path/to/output/file>"

        elements = partition(
        filename=input_filepath
        )

        element_dicts = [element.to_dict() for element in elements]
        json_elements = json.dumps(element_dicts, indent=2)

        # Print the processed data.
        print(json_elements)

        # Write the processed data to a local file.
        with open(output_filepath, "w") as file:
            file.write(json_elements)
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="View the processed data">
        Go to your destination location to view the processed data.
