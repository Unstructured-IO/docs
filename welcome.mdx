### <Icon icon="computer" />   Quickstart: Unstructured Platform

<Info>If you want to use your local machine for either your source (input) files, or the destination (output) location for Unstructured to deliver the processed data, you cannot use this quickstart. You must run code on your local machine instead: skip to the [Quickstart: Unstructured Serverless API services](#quickstart-unstructured-api-service) or [Quickstart: Unstructured open source library](#quickstart-unstructured-open-source-library), later in this article.</Info>

import SharedPlatform from '/snippets/quickstarts/platform.mdx';

### <Icon icon="square-terminal" />   Quickstart: Unstructured API service

This quickstart uses your local machine, with the [Unstructured Python SDK](/api-reference/api-services/sdk) installed. It preprocess a single-file source (input) file on your local machine, and it uses the Free Unstructured API to deliver the processed data to a destination (output) location, also on your local machine. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

<Info>
    The Free Unstructured API has [limits](/api-reference/api-services/free-api#free-unstructured-api-limitations). To remove these limits, sign up for the [Unstructured Serverless API](/api-reference/api-services/saas-api-development-guide).
    
    The Unstructured Python SDK (and the Unstructured JavaScript/TypeScript SDK) work with only a single file at a time and only with local source and destination locations. To process multiple files at a time, or to use non-local source or destination locations, use the [Unstructured Python Ingest CLI](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-cli) or the [Unstructured Ingest Python library](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-python-library) instead.
</Info>

You will need:

- Python installed on your local machine.
- A compatible file on your local machine to be processed. [See the list of supported file types](/api-reference/api-services/overview#supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Sign up">
        [Sign up for the Free edition](https://unstructured.io/api-key-free).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Get your API key and API URL">
        1. Get your Unstructured API key from the welcome email that Unstructured sends you. Store your API key in a secure location. Do not share it with others.
        2. For the Free edition, the API URL is `https://api.unstructured.io/general/v0/general`
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set enviromnent variables">
        1. Set an environment variable named `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` to the value of your Unstructured API key.
        2. Set another environment variable named `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` to the Free Unstructured API URL, which is `https://api.unstructured.io/general/v0/general`

        <Tip>With the Unstructured SDKs, for the Free edition only, you can use the short string `free-api` instead of the Free Unstructured API URL.</Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install the SDK">
        Run the following command:
        ```bash
        pip install unstructured-client
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the code">
        Run the following command, replacing:

        - `<path/to/input/file>` with the source (input) path on your local machine that contains the compatible file for Unstructured to process on its hosted compute resources.
        - `<path/to/output/file>` with the destination (output) path on your local machine that will contain the processed data that Unstructured returns from its hosted compute resources.

        ```python
        import json, os

        from unstructured_client import UnstructuredClient
        from unstructured_client.models import operations, shared

        input_filepath = "<local/path/to/input/file>"
        output_filepath = "<local/path/to/output/file>"

        client = UnstructuredClient(
            api_key_auth=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"),
            server_url=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL"),
        )

        with open(input_filepath, "rb") as f:
            files = shared.Files(
                content=f.read(),
                file_name=input_filepath
            )

        req = operations.PartitionRequest(
            shared.PartitionParameters(
                files=files,
                strategy=shared.Strategy.AUTO
            )
        )

        try:
            res = client.general.partition(request=req)
            element_dicts = [element for element in res.elements]
            json_elements = json.dumps(element_dicts, indent=2)
            
            # Print the processed data.
            print(json_elements)

            # Write the processed data to a local file.
            with open(output_filepath, "w") as file:
            file.write(json_elements)
        except Exception as e:
            print(e)
        ```
        </Step>
    <Step title="View the processed data">
        Go to your destination location to view the processed data.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### <Icon icon="door-open" />   Quickstart: Unstructured open source library

This quickstart uses your local machine for a single-file source (input) location, and a destination (output) location for the processed data. This quickstart also uses local data processing. It does not call Unstructured Serverless API services.

<Info>
    The open source library is [limited](/open-source/introduction/overview#limits) compared to the [Unstructured Platform](/platform/overview) and [Unstructured Serverless API services](/api-reference/api-services/overview).
    
    The open source library is designed primarily to work with only a single file at a time and only with local source and destination locations. To process multiple files at a time, or to use non-local source or destination locations, use the [Unstructured Python Ingest CLI](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-cli) or the [Unstructured Ingest Python library](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-python-library) instead.    
</Info>

You will need:

- Python installed on your local machine.
- A compatible file on your local machine to be processed. [See the list of supported file types](/api-reference/api-services/overview#supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install the open source library">
        Run the following command:
        ```bash
        pip install "unstructured[all-docs]"
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the code">
        Run the following command, replacing:

        - `<path/to/input/file>` with the source (input) path on your local machine that contains the compatible file to process.
        - `<path/to/output/file>` with the destination (output) path on your local machine that will contain the processed data.

        ```python
        import json

        from unstructured.partition.auto import partition

        input_filepath = "<path/to/input/file>"
        output_filepath = "<path/to/output/file>"

        elements = partition(
        filename=input_filepath
        )

        element_dicts = [element.to_dict() for element in elements]
        json_elements = json.dumps(element_dicts, indent=2)

        # Print the processed data.
        print(json_elements)

        # Write the processed data to a local file.
        with open(output_filepath, "w") as file:
            file.write(json_elements)
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="View the processed data">
        Go to your destination location to view the processed data.
    </Step>
</Steps>
