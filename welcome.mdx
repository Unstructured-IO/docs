### <Icon icon="computer" />   Quickstart: Unstructured Platform

<Info>If you want to use your local machine for either the source (input) or the destination (output) location, you cannot use this quickstart. You must run scripts on your local machine instead: skip to the [Quickstart: Unstructured Serverless API Services](#quickstart-unstructured-api-service) or [Quickstart: Unstructured open source library](#quickstart-unstructured-open-source-library), later in this article.</Info>

import SharedPlatform from '/snippets/quickstarts/platform.mdx';

### <Icon icon="square-terminal" />   Quickstart: Unstructured API service

This quickstart uses your local machine for the source (input) and destination (output) locations, and the [Free Unstructured API](/api-reference/api-services/free-api) edition. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

<Info>The Free Unstructured API has [limits](/api-reference/api-services/free-api#free-unstructured-api-limitations). To remove these limits, sign up for the [Unstructured Serverless API](/api-reference/api-services/saas-api-development-guide).</Info>

You will need:

- Python installed on your local machine.
- Compatible files on your local machine to be processed. [See the list of supported file types](/api-reference/api-services/overview#supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Sign up">
        [Sign up for the Free edition](https://unstructured.io/api-key-free).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Get your API key and API URL">
        1. Get your Unstructured API key from the welcome email that Unstructured sends you. Store your API key in a secure location. Do not share it with others.
        2. For the Free edition, the API URL is `https://api.unstructured.io/general/v0/general`
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set enviromnent variables">
        1. Set an environment variable named `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` to the value of your Unstructured API key.
        2. Set another environment variable named `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` to the Free Unstructured API URL, which is `https://api.unstructured.io/general/v0/general`
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install the API library">
        Run the following command:
        ```bash
        pip install "unstructured[all-docs]"
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the code">
        Run the following command, replacing:

        - `<path/to/input>` with the source (input) path on your local machine that contains the compatible files for Unstructured to process on its hosted compute resources.
        - `<path/to/output>` with the destination (output) path on your local machine that will contain the processed data that Unstructured returns from its hosted compute resources.

        ```bash
        unstructured-ingest \
          local \
            --input-path <path/to/input> \
            --output-dir <path/to/output> \
            --partition-by-api \
            --api-key $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY \
            --partition-endpoint $UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL
        ```

        <Info>For speed, this quickstart uses the Unstructured CLI with the minimum number of required command options. You can also use the [Unstructured Python SDK](/api-reference/api-services/sdk-python), the [Unstructured JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](/api-reference/api-services/sdk-jsts), or make a direct [POST request](/api-reference/api-services/post-requests) to the Unstructured API services.</Info>
    </Step>
    <Step title="View the processed data">
        Go to your destination location to view the processed data.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### <Icon icon="door-open" />   Quickstart: Unstructured open source library

This quickstart uses your local machine for the source (input) and destination (output) locations and for local data processing. It does not call Unstructured Serverless API Services.

<Info>The open source library is [limited](/open-source/introduction/overview#limits) compared to the [Unstructured Platform](/platform/overview) and the [Unstructured Serverless API](/api-reference/api-services/overview).</Info>

You will need:

- Python installed on your local machine.
- Compatible files on your local machine to be processed. [See the list of supported file types](/api-reference/api-services/overview#supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install the open source library">
        Run the following command:
        ```bash
        pip install "unstructured[all-docs]"
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the code">
        Run the following command, replacing:

        - `<path/to/input>` with the source (input) path on your local machine that contains the compatible files to process.
        - `<path/to/output>` with the destination (output) path on your local machine that will contain the processed data.

        ```bash
        unstructured-ingest \
          local \
            --input-path <path/to/input> \
            --output-dir <path/to/output>
        ```

        <Info>For speed, this quickstart uses the open source CLI with the minimum number of required command options. You can also use [Python](/open-source/introduction/quick-start) code.</Info>
    </Step>
    <Step title="View the processed data">
        Go to your destination location to view the processed data.
    </Step>
</Steps>
