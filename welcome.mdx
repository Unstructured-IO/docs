### We Offer 3 Products

1. [API](/api-reference/api-services/overview "API") - The quickest way to get started for document transformation.
2. [Platform](/platform/overview "Platform") - Entirely no code enterprise platform to get **all** your data RAG-ready.
3. [Open Source](/open-source/introduction/overview/ "OSS") - Best for prototyping.

### TLDR

If you're here to quickly transform your unstructured documents into understandable JSON, here's the too long didn't read version:

1. **Get an API Key** and **Server URL** by signing up to the [SaaS Unstructured API](https://unstructured.io/api-key-hosted) page on our website.
2. Copy and run this code to **install** the Unstructured Python/JavaScript API SDK.

<CodeGroup>

```bash  Python
pip install unstructured-client
```

```bash  JavaScript
npm install unstructured-client
```
</CodeGroup>
3. Copy and run this code, replacing `api_key_auth`, `server_url`, and `filename` with actual values.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import json

from unstructured_client import UnstructuredClient
from unstructured_client.models import operations, shared

# Update here with your api key and server url
client = UnstructuredClient(
    api_key_auth="YOUR_API_KEY",
    server_url="YOUR_API_URL",
)

# Update here with your filename
filename = "YOUR_FILE_NAME.pdf"

with open(filename, "rb") as f:
    files = shared.Files(
        content=f.read(),
        file_name=filename,
    )

# You can choose FAST, HI_RES or OCR_ONLY for strategy, learn more in the docs at step 4
req = operations.PartitionRequest(
    shared.PartitionParameters(files=files, strategy=shared.Strategy.AUTO)
)

try:
    resp = client.general.partition(req)
    print(json.dumps(resp.elements, indent=2))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

```javascript TypeScript
import { UnstructuredClient } from "unstructured-client";
import { PartitionResponse } from "unstructured-client/sdk/models/operations";
import { Strategy } from "unstructured-client/sdk/models/shared";
import * as fs from "fs";

// Update here with your api 
const key = "YOUR-API-KEY";

// Update here with your serverURL
const client = new UnstructuredClient({
    serverURL: "YOUR_API_URL",
    security: {
        apiKeyAuth: key,
    },
});

// Update here with your filename
filename = "YOUR_FILE_NAME.pdf"
const data = fs.readFileSync(filename);

client.general.partition({
    partitionParameters: {
        files: {
            content: data,
            fileName: filename,
        },
        strategy: Strategy.Auto,
   }
}).then((res: PartitionResponse) => {
    if (res.statusCode == 200) {
        console.log(res.elements);
    }
}).catch((e) => {
    if (e.statusCode) {
        console.log(e.statusCode);
        console.log(e.body);
    } else {
        console.log(e);
    }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

4. **Done!** If you'd like a deeper dive on the API, see the detailed [API Documentation](/api-reference/api-services/overview "API").
