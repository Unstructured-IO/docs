## What is Unstructured?

Unstructured provides a platform and tools to ingest and process unstructured documents for [retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](https://unstructured.io/blog/rag-whitepaper) and [agentic AI](https://unstructured.io/problems-we-solve#powering-agentic-ai).

## <Icon icon="rectangle-terminal" />    Unstructured API quickstart

This quickstart shows how you can use the Unstructured API to quickly and easily see Unstructured's 
transformation results for a single file that is stored locally.

<Tip>
    This quickstart uses the Unstructured API's [Partition Endpoint](/api-reference/partition/overview) and focuses on a single, local file for ease-of-use demonstration purposes. This quickstart also 
    focuses only on a limited set of Unstructured's full capabilities. 
    
    To unlock Unstructured's full feature set, as well as use Unstructured to do 
    large-scale batch processing of multiple files and semi-structured data that are stored in remote locations, 
    [skip over](/api-reference/workflow/overview#quickstart) to an expanded, advanced version of this quickstart that uses the 
    Unstructured API's [Workflow Endpoint](/api-reference/workflow/overview) instead.
