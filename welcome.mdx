Unstructured provides a platform and tools to ingest and process unstructured documents for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and model fine-tuning.

This 60-second video describes more about what Unstructured does and its benefits:

## <Icon icon="square-terminal" />    Unstructured API 

Use scripts or code. Production-ready. Pay as you go. [Learn more](/api-reference/overview).

The Unstructured API consists of two parts:

- The [Unstructured Workflow Endpoint](/api-reference/overview) enables a full range of partitioning, chunking, embedding, and 
  enrichment options for your files and data. It is designed to batch-process files and data in remote locations; send processed results to 
  various storage, databases, and vector stores; and use the latest and highest-performing models on the market today. It has built-in logic 
  to deliver the highest quality results at the lowest cost. [Learn more](/api-reference/overview).
- The [Unstructured Partition Endpoint](/api-reference/partition/overview) is intended for rapid prototyping of Unstructured's 
  various partitioning strategies, with limited support for chunking. It is designed to work only with processing of local files, one file 
  at a time. Use the [Unstructured Workflow Endpoint](/api-reference/overview) for production-level scenarios, file processing in 
  batches, files and data in remote locations, generating embeddings, applying post-transform enrichments, using the latest and 
  highest-performing models, and for the highest quality results at the lowest cost. [Learn more](/api-reference/partition/overview).

Here is a screenshot of some Python code that calls the Unstructured Workflow Endpoint:
