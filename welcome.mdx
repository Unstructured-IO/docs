## What is Unstructured?

<Frame caption="Unstructured turns your organization's unstructured documents into structured, AI-ready data at scale with high performance, accuracy, and relevance">
  <img src="/img/welcome/conceptual-flow.png" alt="Unstructured conceptual data flow" />
</Frame>

Unstructured provides a platform and tools to ingest and process your unstructured documents for:

- [Enhancing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](https://unstructured.io/blog/rag-whitepaper): RAG boosts AI accuracy and relevance by working with the data that's most important to you, providing results that are more current, focused, and meaningful to your queries and tasks.
- [Fueling agentic AI](https://unstructured.io/problems-we-solve#powering-agentic-ai): Agentic AI acts like virtual teammates that can plan, decide, and take action on their own to get things done on your behalf, freeing you up for bigger challenges.

We empower your organization to take full advantage of RAG and agentic AI opportunities through:

- [Rapid prototyping](https://unstructured.io/problems-we-solve#rapid-prototyping): Quickly iterating on AI experiences powered by enterprise data.
- [Replacing do-it-yourself data transformation pipelines](https://unstructured.io/problems-we-solve#replacing-diy-pipelines): Building your own data transformation pipelines is time-consuming and error-prone.
- [Unifying data silos](https://unstructured.io/problems-we-solve#unifying-data-silos): Eliminating data barriers and creating shared GenAI data layers.
- [Continuous data delivery](https://unstructured.io/problems-we-solve#continuous-data-delivery): Scheduling jobs, routing documents, and optimizing every task.
- [Business process automation](https://unstructured.io/problems-we-solve#business-process-automation): Report generation, automatic responses, decision-making, content analysis, and more!

You can use Unstructured through a user interface (UI), an API, or both. Read on to learn more.

## <Icon icon="rectangle-terminal" />    Unstructured API quickstart

This quickstart shows how you can use the Unstructured API to quickly and easily see Unstructured's 
transformation results for files that are stored locally.

<Note>
    This quickstart is designed to work *only by processing local files*.

    To process files (and data) in remote file and blob storage, databases, and vector stores, you must use 
    workflow operations in the Unstructured API other than the ones that are used in this quickstart. To learn how, see for example the notebook 
    [Dropbox-To-Pinecone Connector API Quickstart for Unstructured](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Unstructured-IO/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/Dropbox_To_Pinecone_Connector_Quickstart.ipynb).  
</Note>

1. If you do not already have an Unstructured account, [sign up for free](https://unstructured.io/?modal=try-for-free). 
   After you sign up, you are automatically signed in to your Unstructured **Let's Go** account, at [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io).

   <Note>
       If you already have an Unstructured **Pay-As-You-Go** or **Business SaaS** account, you are already signed up for Unstructured. 
       Sign in to your existing Unstructured **Pay-As-You-Go** or **Business SaaS** account, at [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io).
   
       If you already have an Unstructured **dedicated instance** or **in-VPC** deployment, your sign-in link will be unique to your deployment. 
       If you're not sure what your unique sign-in link is, see your Unstructured account administrator, or email Unstructured Support at 
       [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).
   </Note>

2. Get your Unstructured API key:

   a. After you sign in to your Unstructured account, click **API Keys** on the sidebar.<br/>

      <Note>
          For a **Business** account, before you click **API Keys**, make sure you have selected the organizational workspace you want to create an API key 
          for. Each API key works with one and only one organizational workspace. [Learn more](/ui/account/workspaces#create-an-api-key-for-a-workspace).
      </Note>

   b. Click **Generate API Key**.<br/>
   c. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish generating the key.<br/>
   d. Click the **Copy** icon next to your new key to add the key to your system's clipboard. If you lose this key, simply return and click the **Copy** icon again.<br/>

3. Now that you have your Unstructured API key, choose one of the following options to continue:

   - [Use a remote notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Unstructured-IO/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/Unstructured_API_On_Demand_Jobs_Quickstart.ipynb) - This option uses a remotely hosted Google Colab notebook. There are no additional setup steps required.
   - [Use your local machine](/api-reference/quickstart) - This option requires you to install the Unstructured Python SDK on your local machine.
