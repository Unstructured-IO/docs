<Info>If you want to use your local machine for either your source (input) files, or the destination (output) location for Unstructured to deliver the processed data, you cannot use this quickstart. You must run code on your local machine instead: skip to the [Quickstart: Unstructured Serverless API](#quickstart-unstructured-serverless-api), later in this article.</Info>

### <Icon icon="square-terminal" />   Quickstart: Unstructured Serverless API

This quickstart uses your local machine, with the [Unstructured Ingest Python library](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-python-library) installed. It preprocesses source (input) files on your local machine, and it uses the Unstructured Serverless API to deliver the processed data to a destination (output) location, also on your local machine. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

You will need:

- Python installed on your local machine.
- Compatible files on your local machine to be processed. [See the list of supported file types](#supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Sign up">
        Sign up for a 14-day trial of the Unstructured Serverless API at [https://app.unstructured.io](https://app.unstructured.io).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Sign in">
        1. Enter your email address and then click **Sign In** to receive a magic link to sign in to your personalized dashboard, or authenticate yourself with your Google or GitHub account.
        2. Once you authenticate with the magic link or with your Google or GitHub account, your dashboard appears.
    </Step> 
    <Step title="Get your API key and API URL">
        1. On the sidebar, click **API Keys**, if it is not already selected.
        2. To get your API key, click the copy icon in the **Actions** column for your API key, and then click **Key Only**. Store your copied API key in a secure location. Do not share it with others.
        3. To get your API URL, click the copy icon next to the URL next to **API URL**. Store your copied API URL in a secure location. Do not share it with others.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set environment variables">
        1. Set an environment variable named `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` to the value of your Unstructured API key.
        2. Set another environment variable named `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` to the value of your Unstructured API URL.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install the Ingest Python library">
        Run the following command:
        ```bash
        pip install unstructured-ingest
        ```
        <AdditionalIngestDependencies />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the code">
        Run the following code, replacing:

        - `<path/to/input>` with the source (input) path to the directory on your local machine that contains the compatible files for Unstructured to process on its hosted compute resources.
        - `<path/to/output>` with the destination (output) path to the directory on your local machine that will contain the processed data that Unstructured returns from its hosted compute resources.

        <LocalToLocalPythonIngestLibrary />
    </Step>
    <Step title="View the processed data">
        Go to your destination location to view the processed data.
    </Step>
</Steps>
