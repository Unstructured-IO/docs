Unstructured provides a platform and tools to ingest and process unstructured documents for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and model fine-tuning.

This 40-second video demonstrates a simple use case that Unstructured helps solve:

<Info>If you want to use your local machine for either your source (input) files, or the destination (output) location for Unstructured to deliver the processed data, you cannot use this quickstart. You must run code on your local machine instead: skip to the [Quickstart: Unstructured Serverless API](#quickstart-unstructured-serverless-api), later in this article.</Info>

### <Icon icon="square-terminal" />   Quickstart: Unstructured Serverless API

This quickstart uses your local machine, with the [Unstructured Ingest Python library](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-python-library) installed. It preprocesses source (input) files on your local machine, and it uses the Unstructured Serverless API to deliver the processed data to a destination (output) location, also on your local machine. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

The requirements are as follows.

- Python installed on your local machine.
- Compatible files on your local machine to be processed. [See the list of supported file types](#supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Sign up">
        Go to the [For Developers](https://unstructured.io/developers) page and enter your information.

        <Note>
            By signing up through the [For Developers](https://unstructured.io/developers) page, your Unstructured account will run within the context of the Unstructured Platform on 
            Unstructured's own hosted cloud resources. Also, after your first 14 days of usage or more than 1000 processed pages per day, 
            whichever comes first, your account is then billed at Unstructured's standard service usage rates. You can always 
            start a prepaid subscription in exchange for usage rate discounts. To switch your account from a pay-as-you-go plan to a prepaid subscription, 
            contact Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).
            
            If you would rather run the Unstructured Platform within the context of your own virtual private cloud (VPC), 
            or you want to make a long-term billing commitment in exchange for deeply discounted service usage rates, 
            stop here and sign up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead.
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Sign in">
        ![Sign in to your Unstructured account](/img/platform/Signin.png)
        1. After you have signed up through the [For Developers](https://unstructured.io/developers) page, the Unstructured Platform sign-in page appears.

           <Note>
              If you signed up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead, your sign-in process will 
              be different. For enterprise sign-in guidance, contact Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).
           </Note>

        2. Click **Google** or **GitHub** to sign in with the Google or GitHub account that you signed up with through the **For Developers** page. 
           Or, enter the email address that you signed up with, and then click **Sign In**.
        3. If you entered your email address, check your email inbox for a message from Unstructured. In that email, click the **Sign In** link.
        4. The first time you sign in, read the terms and conditions, and then click **Accept**.
    </Step> 
    <Step title="Get your API key and API URL">
        ![Unstructured account settings](/img/platform/AccountSettings.png)

        ![Unstructured API key and API URL](/img/platform/APIKeyURL.png)
        1. At the bottom of the sidebar, click your user icon, and then click **Account Settings**.
        2. On the account settings sidebar, click **API Keys**, if it is not already selected.
        3. To get your API key, click the copy icon in the **Actions** column for your API key, and then click **Key Only**. Store your copied API key in a secure location. Do not share it with others.
        4. To get your API URL, click the copy icon next to the URL next to **API URL**. Store your copied API URL in a secure location. Do not share it with others.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set environment variables">
        1. Set an environment variable named `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` to the value of your Unstructured API key.
        2. Set another environment variable named `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` to the value of your Unstructured API URL.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install the Ingest Python library">
        Run the following command:
        ```bash
        pip install unstructured-ingest
        ```
        <AdditionalIngestDependencies />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the code">
        Run the following code, replacing:

        - `<path/to/input>` with the source (input) path to the directory on your local machine that contains the compatible files for Unstructured to process on its hosted compute resources.
        - `<path/to/output>` with the destination (output) path to the directory on your local machine that will contain the processed data that Unstructured returns from its hosted compute resources.

        <LocalToLocalPythonIngestLibrary />
    </Step>
    <Step title="View the processed data">
        Go to your destination location to view the processed data.
    </Step>
</Steps>
