description: "**Unstructured** provides tools to ingest and preprocess unstructured documents for `Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)` and `Fine Tuning`."

We offer **3 products**:

1. [API](/api-reference/api-services/overview "API") - The quickest way to get started for document transformation.
2. [Open Source](/open-source/introduction/overview/ "OSS") - Best for prototyping.
3. [Enterprise Platform](/platform/overview "Platform") - Entirely no code platform for end-to-end RAG.


## TLDR

If you're here just to process docs, here's the too long didn't read version:


1. **Get an API Key** and **Server URL** by signing up to the [SaaS Unstructured API](https://unstructured.io/api-key-hosted) page on our website.
2. Copy and run this code to **install** the Unstructured Python/JavaScript API SDK.
<CodeGroup>

```bash  Python
pip install unstructured-client
```

```bash  JavaScript
npm install unstructured-client
```
</CodeGroup>
3. Copy and run this code, replacing `api_key_auth`, `server_url`, and `filename` with actual values.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from unstructured_client import UnstructuredClient
from unstructured_client.models import shared
from unstructured_client.models.errors import SDKError

client = UnstructuredClient(
    api_key_auth="YOUR_API_KEY",
    server_url="YOUR_API_URL",
)

filename = "sample-docs/family-day.eml"

with open(filename, "rb") as f:
    files=shared.Files(
        content=f.read(),
        file_name=filename,
    )

req = shared.PartitionParameters(files=files)

try:
    resp = client.general.partition(req)
    print(resp.elements)
except SDKError as e:
    print(e)
```

```javascript JavaScript
import { UnstructuredClient } from "unstructured-client";
import { PartitionResponse } from "unstructured-client/dist/sdk/models/operations";
import * as fs from "fs";

const key = "YOUR-API-KEY";

const client = new UnstructuredClient({
    serverURL: "YOUR_API_URL",
    security: {
        apiKeyAuth: key,
    },
});

const filename = "sample-docs/ragtest.pdf";
const data = fs.readFileSync(filename);

client.general.partition({
    files: {
        content: data,
        fileName: filename,
    },
}).then((res: PartitionResponse) => {
    if (res.statusCode == 200) {
        console.log(res.elements);
    }
}).catch((e) => {
    console.log(e.statusCode);
    console.log(e.body);
});
```
</CodeGroup>

4. **Done!** If you'd like a deeper dive on the API, see the detailed [API Documentation](/api-reference/api-services/overview "API").
