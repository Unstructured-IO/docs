title: Chunking
---

After partitioning, _chunking_ rearranges the resulting document elements into manageable "chunks" to stay within 
the limits of an embedding model and to improve retrieval precision. The goal is to retrieve only parts of documents 
that contain only the information that is relevant to a user's query. You can specify if and how Unstructured chunks 
those elements, based on your intended end use. 

During chunking, Unstructured uses a basic chunking strategy that attempts to combine two or more consecutive text elements 
into each chunk that fits together within **Max characters**. To determine the best **Max characters** length, see the documentation 
for the embedding model that you want to use.

You can further control this behavior with by-title, by-page, or by-similarity chunking strategies. 
In all cases, Unstructured will only split individual elements if they exceed the specified **Max characters** length. 
After chunking, you will have document elements of only the following types:

- `CompositeElement`: Any text element will become a `CompositeElement` after chunking. A composite element can be a
combination of two or more original text elements that together fit within the **Max characters** length. It can also be a single
element that doesn't leave room in the chunk for any others but fits by itself. Or it can be a fragment of an original
text element that was too big to fit in one chunk and required splitting.
- `Table`: A table element is not combined with other elements, and if it fits within **Max characters** it will remain as is.
- `TableChunk`: Large tables that exceed **Max characters** are split into special `TableChunk` elements.

Here are a few examples:

```json
{
    "type": "CompositeElement",
    "element_id": "3e891e70121efac5f8374e4f1d41f25c",
    "text": "PORTABLE DOCUMENT FORMAT (PDF) SPECIFICATIONS...<full-content-redacted-for-brevity>...",
    "metadata": {
      "filetype": "application/pdf",
      "languages": [
        "eng"
      ],
      "page_number": 1,
      "orig_elements": "eJy...<full-content-redacted-for-brevity>...tY0=",
      "filename": "Portable-Document-Format-Specifications.pdf"
    }
}
```

```json
{
    "type": "Table",
    "element_id": "2abca97d9f7dde6557cda4731f5e1d01",
    "text": "Date 2005-04-08 2008-06-04 2011-12-20 2012-1-13 2014-9-26 2016-9-14...<full-content-redacted-for-brevity>...",
    "metadata": {
      "text_as_html": "<table><thead><tr><th>Date</th><th>Version</th><th>Summary of Revisions</th></tr></thead><tbody>...<full-content-redacted-for-brevity>...",
      "filetype": "application/pdf",
      "languages": [
        "eng"
      ],
      "page_number": 3,
      "orig_elements": "eJz...<full-content-redacted-for-brevity>...r8=",
      "filename": "Portable-Document-Format-Specifications.pdf"
    }
}
```

The following sections provide information about the available chunking strategies and their settings.

<Note>You can change a workflow's preconfigured strategy only through [Custom](/platform/workflows#create-a-custom-workflow) workflow settings.</Note>

## Basic chunking strategy

The basic chunking strategy uses only **Max characters** and **New after n characters** to combine sequential elements to maximally fill each chunk. 
This strategy does not use section boundaries, page boundaries, or content similarities to determine the chunks' contents.

To use this chunking strategy, choose **Chunk by character** in the **Chunkers** section of a **Chunker** node in a workflow.

## Chunk by title strategy

The by-title chunking strategy attempts to preserve section boundaries when determining the chunks' contents. 
A single chunk should not contain text that occurred in two different sections. When a new section starts, the existing 
chunk is closed and a new one is started, even if the next element would fit in the prior chunk.

To use this chunking strategy, choose **Chunk by title** in the **Chunkers** section of a **Chunker** node in a workflow.

## Chunk by page strategy

The by-page chunking strategy attempts to preserve page boundaries when determining the chunks' contents. 
A single chunk should not contain text that occurred in two different page. When a new page starts, the existing 
chunk is closed and a new one is started, even if the next element would fit in the prior chunk.

To use this chunking strategy, choose **Chunk by page** in the **Chunkers** section of a **Chunker** node in a workflow.

## Chunk By similarity strategy

The by-similarity chunking strategy uses the 
[sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1) embedding model 
to identify topically similar sequential elements and combines them into chunks.

As with the other chunking strategies, chunks will never exceed the absolute maximum chunk size set by **Max characters**. For this reason,
not all elements that share a topic will necessarily appear in the same chunk. However, with this strategy you can
guarantee that two elements with low similarity will not be combined in a single chunk.

To use this chunking strategy, choose **Chunk by similarity** in the **Chunkers** section of a **Chunker** node in a workflow.

You can control the level of topic similarity you require for elements to have by setting [Similarity threshold](#similarity-threshold).

## Max characters setting

Specifies the absolute maximum number of characters in a chunk.

To specify this setting, enter a number into the **Max characters** field.

This setting applies to all of the chunking strategies.

## Combine text under n characters setting

Combines elements from a section into a chunk until a section reaches a length of this many characters.

To specify this setting, enter a number into the **Combine text under n chars** field.

This setting applies only to the chunking strategy **Chunk by title**.

## Include original elements setting

If the **Include original elements** box is checked, the elements that were used to form a chunk appear in the `metadata` field's `orig_elements` field for that chunk.

This setting applies to all of the chunking strategies.

## Multipage sections setting

If the **Multipage sections** box is checked, this allows sections to span multiple pages.

This setting applies only to the chunking strategy **Chunk by title**.

## New after n characters setting

Closes new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. This is an approximate limit.

To specify this setting, enter a number into the **New after n characters** field.

This setting applies only to the chunking strategies **Chunk by character**, **Chunk by title**, and **Chunk by page**.

## Overlap setting

Applies a prefix of this many trailing characters from the prior text-split chunk to second and later chunks formed from oversized elements by text-splitting.

To specify this setting, enter a number into the **Overlap** field.

This setting applies only to the chunking strategies **Chunk by character**, **Chunk by title**, and **Chunk by page**.

## Overlap all setting

If the **Overlap all** box is checked, applies overlap to "normal" chunks formed by combining whole elements. Use with caution as this can introduce noise into otherwise clean semantic units.

This setting applies only to the chunking strategies **Chunk by character**, **Chunk by title**, and **Chunk by page**.

## Similarity threshold setting

Specifies the minimum similarity that text in consecutive elements must have to be included in the same chunk. 
This must be a value between `0.0` and `1.0`, exclusive (`0.01` to `0.99`). The default is `0.5` if not otherwise specified.

To specify this setting, enter a number into the **Similarity threshold** field.

This setting applies only to the chunking strategy **Chunk by similarity**.

## Contextual chunking

A technique known as _contextual chunking_ prepends chunk-specific explanatory context to each chunk. 
Contextual chunking has been shown to enhance traditional RAG solutions by yielding 
significant improvements in retrieval accuracy, which directly translates to better performance in downstream tasks. 
[Learn more](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval).

To apply contextual chunking, switch on the **Contextual chunking** toggle in the settings for any chunking strategy.

This chunk-specific explanatory context information is typically a couple of sentences in length. 
Contextual chunking happens before any embeddings are generated. 

When contextual chunking is applied, the contextual information in each chunk begins with `Prefix:` and ends with a semicolon (`;`). 
The chunk's original content begins with `Original:`.

For example, without contextual chunking applied, elements would for instance be generated similar to the following.

{
    "type": "CompositeElement",
    "element_id": "aa482034de5ade41b7223bb3beeb6a22",
    "text": "THE\n\nCONSTITUTION of the United States\n\nG\n\nNATIONAL 
      CONSTITUTION CENTER\n\nWe the People of the United States, in

      ...<full-content-redacted-for-brevity>...",
    "metadata": {
        "filename": "constitution.pdf",
        "filetype": "application/pdf",
        "languages": [
            "eng"
        ],
        "page_number": 1
    }
},
{
    "type": "CompositeElement",
    "element_id": "59fbfcfb51e52c426df4c48a620c6031",
    "text": "SECTION. 2\n\nThe House of Representatives shall be 
        composed of Mem- bers chosen every second Year by the People 
        of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall

    "metadata": {
        "filename": "constitution.pdf",
        "filetype": "application/pdf",

            "eng"
        ],
        "page_number": 2
    }
},
```

Applying contextual chunking to those same elements would result in the following output.
