    This feature works only with **Build it with me > Custom** and **Build it myself** [workflows](/platform/workflows).

    This feature is _not_ supported for **Basic**, **Advanced**, and **Platinum** [workflows](/platform/workflows).

The Unstructured Platform can offer you a recommendation for an ideal [embedding provider and model](/platform/embedding) 
and [chunking strategy and settings](/platform/chunking) for your source files and non-file data documents and records. 
These recommendations are optimized to work well across a variety of 
vector stores, RAG applications, and model fine-tuning scenarios. 

Unstructured's embedding provider and model and chunking strategy and settings recommendations are especially useful if you are not familiar with how the 
various embedding providers and models and chunking strategies and settings can be applied for optimal results. If you are comfortable with embedding and chunking, 
you can use these recommendations to help inform your current strategies. 

Unstructured makes its recommendations by using the related [source connector](/platform/sources/overview) to access, process, and analyze a 
sampling of files or non-file data documents or records from the source location, depending on the connector's type. Unstructured then recommends 
an embedding provider and model and chunking strategy and settings based on this analysis.

import SharedPagesBilling from '/snippets/general-shared-text/pages-billing.mdx';

<Note>
    Performing a recommendation will result in billing to your Unstructured account. To make its recommendation, Unstructured 
    must process and analyze a sampling of up to 50 files or 50 non-file data documents or records from the source location, depending on the source connector's type. 
    Your Unstructured account is billed for the equivalent number of pages.

## Request a recommendation

1. On the sidebar, click **Connectors**.
2. Click **Sources**.
3. Click the name of the source connector that you want to use. If you do not have a source connector, 
   [create one](/platform/sources/overview).
4. If you're requesting a recomendation for the first time for this connector, click the **Run Recommender** button. 

   If you have previously requested a recommendation for this connector, you can make another request by clicking the **Run Again** button. 
   This can be useful if you significantly changed the files or non-file data documents or records in the source location since you previously 
   requested a recommendation. 

   <Tip>
       If the **Run Recommender** or **Run Again** button is not visible, or if they are visible but not enabled, there is likely something wrong 
       with your source connector.
       
       To fix this, try clicking the edit (pencil) icon, 
       make any necessary changes to the connector's previous settings, and then click **Save and Test**. 
       Keep repeating this step as needed until a **Successful** icon appears. When this icon appears, the 
       **Run Recommender** or **Run Again** button should be visible and enabled.
   </Tip>

5. Two **Scheduled** statuses appear, one for **Embed** and another for **Chunk**.
6. After several minutes, the **Scheduled** statuses are replaced by **Running**.
7. After several more minutes, the **Running** statuses are replaced by **Finished**.
8. To view the recommendation, click **View**.

The **Auto Recommender Results** pane shows Unstructured's recommended embedding provider and model and chunking strategy and settings for your source 
files or non-file data documents or records, depending on the source connector's type.

## Implement an embed recommendation

2. To implement the recommendation, expand the **Next Steps** section and follow the on-screen instructions. 

## Implement a chunking recommendation
    
1. In the **Auto Recommender Results** pane, in the **Chunk Recommendation** area, note the recommended chunking strategy and settings.
2. To implement the recommendation, expand the **Next Steps** section and follow the on-screen instructions.
