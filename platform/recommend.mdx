The Unstrucutured Platform provides an embedding recommender that identifies the best 
[embedding](/platform/embedding) model to generate embeddings for documents in a given source location. 
This is great for those beginning with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) 
or for those who do not want to spend lots of time learning about how to compare various embedding models. 
Just point the Unstructured Platform to your [source connector](/platform/sources/overview) and, after just a few minutes of 
back-end analysis, Unstructured delivers its recommendation to you.

## Get a recommendation

1. In the Unstructured Platform, [create a source connector](/platform/sources/overview), if you do not already have one, for the source location that you want to get a recommendation for.
2. On the sidebar, click **Recommend**.
3. In the **Embed Recommender** pane, for **Sources**, select the source connector.
4. Click **Start**.
5. In the **Recommendations** pane, wait until the **Recommended Model** field displays the recommendation.
6. To get more details, click the row in the list for your source connector.

## Apply a recommendation to a custom workflow

For a [Build it with me - Custom](/platform/workflows#build-it-with-me-custom) workflow:

1. In the **Embed** section, for **Provider**, select the recommended embedding provider's name.
2. If you select **OpenAI**, then for **Model**, select the recommended embedding model's name.
3. Make a note of the number of dimensions displayed for the model that you selected. If you selected **VertexAI** instead of 
   **OpenAI**, the number of dimensions is 768.
4. To save these settings, continue creating or editing the workflow as usual.

<Note>
    The number of dimensions for the embedding model that you select for this workflow must match the number of dimensions in 
    this workflow's destination location. Otherwise, this workflow might fail or produce unexpected results. To set the number of 
    dimensions in the destination, see the destination provider's documentation.
</Note>

For a [Build it myself](/platform/workflows#build-it-myself) workflow:

1. Add a **Transform > Embedder** node.
2. In the **Embedder** node's settings pane, with the **Details** button already clicked, for **Select Embedding Provider**, 
   select the recommended embedding provider's name.
3. If you select **OpenAI**, then for **OpenAI**, select the recommended embedding model's name.
4. Make a note of the number of dimensions displayed for the model that you selected. If you selected **VertexAI** instead of 
   **OpenAI**, the number of dimensions is 768.
5. To save these settings, continue creating or editing the workflow as usual.

<Note>
    The number of dimensions for the embedding model that you select for this workflow must match the number of dimensions in 
    this workflow's destination location. Otherwise, this workflow might fail or produce unexpected results. To set the number of 
    dimensions in the destination, see the destination provider's documentation.
