- To get information about a destination connector, use the `GET` method to call the `/destinations/<connector-id>` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#get-a-destination-connector).
- To create a destination connector, use the `POST` method to call the `/destinations` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#create-a-destination-connector).
- To update a destination connector, use the `PUT` method to call the `/destinations/<connector-id>` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#update-a-destination-connector).
- To delete a destination connector, use the `DELETE` method to call the `/destinations/<connector-id>` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#delete-a-destination-connector).
