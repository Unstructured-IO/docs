<SnowflakePrerequisites />

To create or change a Snowflake destination connector, see the following examples.

import SnowflakeSDK from '/snippets/destination_connectors/snowflake_sdk.mdx';
import SnowflakeAPIRESTCreate from '/snippets/destination_connectors/snowflake_rest_create.mdx';
import SnowflakeAPIRESTChange from '/snippets/destination_connectors/snowflake_rest_change.mdx';

<CodeGroup>
    <SnowflakeSDK />
    <SnowflakeAPIRESTCreate />
    <SnowflakeAPIRESTChange />
</CodeGroup>

Replace the preceding placeholders as follows:

import SnowflakeAPIPlaceholders from '/snippets/general-shared-text/snowflake-api-placeholders.mdx';

<SnowflakeAPIPlaceholders />

To change a connector, replace `<connector-id>` with the destination connector's unique ID. 
To get this ID, see [List destination connectors](/platform/api/overview#list-destination-connectors).
