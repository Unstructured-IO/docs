The [Unstructured Platform](/platform/overview) features a no-code user interface for transforming your unstructured data into data that is ready 
for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

The Unstructured Platform also provides a back-end API for automation usage scenarios as well as for documentation, reporting, and recovery needs.

## Requirements

To use the Unstructured Platform API, you must have:

- **An Unstructured account**, created through one of the following means:

  - The [Unstructured Serverless API](https://unstructured.io/api-key-hosted) sign-up page.
  - The [For Developers](https://unstructured.io/developers) sign-up page.
  - The [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) sign-up page.

- **An Unstructured API key**, created through the Unstructured account console.

  [Free Unstructured API](/api-reference/api-services/free-api) keys are _not_ supported.

  <Note>
      If you signed up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page, your API key creation process 
      might be different. For API key creation guidance, email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io). 
  </Note>

- **The Unstructured Platform API URL**, which is `https://platform.unstructuredapp.io`

  <Note>
      If you signed up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page, your API URL 
      might be different. For API URL guidance, email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io). 
      If your API URL is different, be sure to substitute `https://platform.unstructuredapp.io` for your 
      API URL throughout the following examples.
  </Note>

The Unstructured Platform API is offered as a set of Representational State Transfer (REST) endpoints, which you can call through standard REST-enabled 
utilities, tools, programming languages, packages, and libraries. The following sections describe how to call the Unstructured Platform API with 
`curl` and Postman. You can adapt this information as needed for your preferred programming languages and libraries, for example by using the 
`requests` library with Python.

<Warning>
    The Unstructured Platform API is separate from [Unstructured Serverless API services](/api-reference/api-services/overview) and 
    [Unstructured Ingest](/api-reference/ingest/overview). 

    Because of this separation, the following Unstructured SDKs, tools, and libraries do _not_ work with the Unstructured Platform API:

    - The [Unstructured Python SDK](/api-reference/api-services/sdk-python)
    - The [Unstructured JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](/api-reference/api-services/sdk-jsts)
    - [Local single-file POST requests](/api-reference/api-services/post-requests) to Unstructured Serverless API services
    - The [Unstructured open source Python library](/api-reference/api-services/partition-via-api)
    - The [Unstructued Ingest CLI](/api-reference/ingest/ingest-cli)
    - The [Unstructured Ingest Python library](/api-reference/ingest/python-ingest)

    [Free Unstructured API](/api-reference/api-services/free-api) accounts are also _not_ supported.

    The following Unstructured API URLs are also _not_ supported:

    - `https://api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general` (the Unstructured Serverless API URL)
    - `https://api.unstructured.io/general/v0/general` (the Free Unstructured API URL)
</Warning>

## Basics

The Unstructured Platform API enables you to work with [connectors](#connectors),
[workflows](#workflows), and [jobs](#jobs) in the Unstructured Platform.

- A _source connector_ ingests files or data into Unstructured from a source location.
- A _destination connector_ sends the processed data from Unstructured to a destination location.
- A _workflow_ defines how Unstructured will process the data.
- A _job_ runs a workflow at a specific point in time.

For general information about these objects, see:

- [Connectors](/platform/connectors)
- [Workflows](/platform/workflows)
- [Jobs](/platform/jobs)

In the following `curl` examples, we recommend setting the following environment variables first:

```bash
export UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL="https://platform.unstructuredapp.io"
export UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY="<your-unstructured-api-key>"
```

This enables you to more easily run the following `curl` examples and helps prevent you from storing scripts 
that contain sensitive URLs and API keys in public source code repositories.

In the following Postman examples, we recommend setting the following global variables first:

1. In Postman, on your workspace's sidebar, click **Environments**.
2. Click **Globals**.
3. Create two global variables with the following settings:

   - **Variable**: `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL`
   - **Type**: `default`
   - **Initial value**: `https://platform.unstructuredapp.io`
   <br/>
   - **Variable**: `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL`
   - **Type**: `secret`
   - **Initial value**: `<your-unstructured-api-key>`

4. Click **Save**.

This enables you to more easily run the following examples in Postman and helps prevent you from storing 
Postman collections that contain sensitive URLs and API keys in public source code repositories.

## Connectors

You can [list](#list-source-connectors), 
[get](#get-a-source-connector),
