To use the [Unstructured Platform API](/platform/api/overview) to manage source connectors, do the following:

- To get a list of available source connectors, use the `GET` method to call the `/sources` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#list-source-connectors).
- To get information about a source connector, use the `GET` method to call the `/sources/<connector-id>` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#get-a-source-connector).
- To create a source connector, use the `POST` method to call the `/sources` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#create-a-source-connector).
- To update a source connector, use the `PUT` method to call the `/sources/<connector-id>` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#update-a-source-connector).
- To delete a source connector, use the `DELETE` method to call the `/sources/<connector-id>` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#delete-a-source-connector). 

To create a source connector, you must also provide a request body that contains settings that are specific to that connector. 
For the list of specific settings, see:
