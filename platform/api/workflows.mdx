title: Workflows
---

To use the [Unstructured Platform API](/platform/api/overview) to manage workflows, do the following:

- To get a list of available workflows, use the `GET` method to call the `/workflows` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#list-workflows).
- To get information about a workflow, use the `GET` method to call the `/workflows/<workflow-id>` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#get-a-workflow).
- To create a workflow, use the `POST` method to call the `/workflows` endpoint. [Learn more](#create-a-workflow).
- To run a workflow manually, use the `POST` method to call the `/workflows/<workflow-id>/run` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#run-a-workflow).
- To update a workflow, use the `PUT` method to call the `/workflows/<workflow-id>` endpoint. [Learn more](#update-a-workflow).
- To delete a workflow, use the `DELETE` method to call the `/workflows/<workflow-id>` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#delete-a-workflow).

The following examples assume that you have already met the [requirements](/platform/api/overview#requirements) and 
understand the [basics](/platform/api/overview#basics) of working with the Unstructured Platform API.

## Create a workflow

To create a workflow, use the `POST` method to call the `/workflows` endpoint. In the request body, 
specify the settings for the workflow, as follows:

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="curl">
        ```bash
        curl --request POST \
        "$UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL/workflows" \
        --header "unstructured-api-key: $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY" \
        --header "accept: application/json" \
        --data \
        '{
            "name": "<name>",
            "source_connector_id": "<source-connector-id>",
            "destination_connector_id": "<destination-connector-id>",
            "type": "<type>",
            "schedule": "<schedule>"
        }'
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Postman">
        1. In the method drop-down list, select **POST**.
        2. In the address box, enter the following URL:

            ```text
            {{UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL}}/workflows
            ```

        3. On the **Headers** tab, enter the following headers:

            - **Key**: `unstructured-api-key`, **Value**: `{{UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY}}`
            - **Key**: `accept`, **Value**: `application/json`

        4. On the **Body** tab, select **raw** and **JSON**, and specify the settings for the workflow:

           ```json
           {
               "name": "<name>",
               "source_connector_id": "<source-connector-id>",
               "destination_connector_id": "<destination-connector-id>",
               "type": "<type>",
               "schedule": "<schedule>"
           }
           ```

        5. Click **Send**.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Replace the preceding placeholders as follows:

- `<name>` (_required_) - A unique name for this workflow.
- `<source-connector-id>` (_required_) - The ID of the target source connector. To get the ID, 
    use the `GET` method to call the `/sources` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#list-source-connectors).
- `<destination-connector-id>` (_required_) - The ID of the target destination connector. To get the ID, 
    use the `GET` method to call the `/destinations` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#list-destination-connectors).
- `<type>` (_required_) - The workflow optimization type. Available values include `advanced`, `basic`, and `platinum`.
- `<schedule>` - The repeating automatic run schedule. Available values include the following:

  - `don't repeat` (_default_) - This workflow will not run on a repeating automatic schedule. To run the workflow manually, 
  Use the `POST` method to call the `/workflows/<workflow-id>/run` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#run-a-workflow).
  - `every 15 minutes` - Run this workflow once every 15 minutes.
  - `every hour` - Run this workflow once at the beginning of every hour.
  - `every 2 hours` - Run this workflow once at the beginning of the hour every 2 hours.
  - `every 4 hours` - Run this workflow once at the beginning of the hour every 4 hours.
  - `every 6 hours` - Run this workflow once at the beginning of the hour every 6 hours.
  - `every 8 hours` - Run this workflow once at the beginning of the hour every 8 hours.
  - `every 10 hours` - Run this workflow once at the beginning of the hour every 10 hours.
  - `every 12 hours` - Run this workflow once at the beginning of the hour every 12 hours.
  - `daily` - Run this workflow once each day. To specify the time of day, ...
  - `weekly` - Run this workflow once on each of the specified days of each week. 
  To specify the days of the week, .... 
  To specify the time for all of these days, ....
  - `monthly` Run this workflow once on each of the specified days of each month. 
  To specify the days of the month, .... 
  To specify the time for all of these days, ....

  The default value is `don't repeat` if not otherwise specified.

## Update a workflow

To update information about a workflow, use the `PUT` method to call the `/workflows/<workflow-id>` endpoint, replacing 
`<workflow-id>` with the workflow's unique ID. To get this ID, see [List workflows](#list-workflows).

In the request body, specify the settings for the workflow. For the specific settings to include, see 
[Create a workflow](/platform/api/workflows#create-a-workflow).
