To use the [Unstructured Platform API](/platform/api/overview) to manage workflows, do the following:

- To get a list of available workflows, use the `GET` method to call the `/workflows` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#list-workflows).
- To get information about a workflow, use the `GET` method to call the `/workflows/<workflow-id>` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#get-a-workflow).
- To create a workflow, use the `POST` method to call the `/workflows` endpoint. [Learn more](#create-a-workflow).
- To run a workflow manually, use the `POST` method to call the `/workflows/<workflow-id>/run` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#run-a-workflow).
- To update a workflow, use the `PUT` method to call the `/workflows/<workflow-id>` endpoint. [Learn more](#update-a-workflow).
- To delete a workflow, use the `DELETE` method to call the `/workflows/<workflow-id>` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#delete-a-workflow).
