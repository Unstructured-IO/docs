title: Workflows
---

To use the [Unstructured Platform API](/platform/api/overview) to manage workflows, do the following:

- To get a list of available workflows, use the `GET` method to call the `/workflows` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#list-workflows).
- To get information about a workflow, use the `GET` method to call the `/workflows/<workflow-id>` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#get-a-workflow).
- To create a workflow, use the `POST` method to call the `/workflows` endpoint. [Learn more](#create-a-workflow).
- To run a workflow manually, use the `POST` method to call the `/workflows/<workflow-id>/run` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#run-a-workflow).
- To update a workflow, use the `PUT` method to call the `/workflows/<workflow-id>` endpoint. [Learn more](#update-a-workflow).
- To delete a workflow, use the `DELETE` method to call the `/workflows/<workflow-id>` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#delete-a-workflow).

The following examples assume that you have already met the [requirements](/platform/api/overview#requirements) and 
understand the [basics](/platform/api/overview#basics) of working with the Unstructured Platform API.

## Create a workflow

To create a workflow, use the `POST` method to call the `/workflows` endpoint. In the request body, 
specify the settings for the workflow, as follows:

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="curl">
        ```bash
        curl --request 'POST' --location \
        "$UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL/workflows" \
        --header "unstructured-api-key: $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY" \
        --header 'accept: application/json' \
        --data \
        '{
            "name": "<name>",
            "source_id": "<source-connector-id>",
            "destination_id": "<destination-connector-id>",
            "workflow_type": "<type>",
            "schedule": "<schedule-timeframe>"
        }'
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Postman">
        1. In the method drop-down list, select **POST**.
        2. In the address box, enter the following URL:

            ```text
            {{UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL}}/workflows
            ```

        3. On the **Headers** tab, enter the following headers:

            - **Key**: `unstructured-api-key`, **Value**: `{{UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY}}`
            - **Key**: `accept`, **Value**: `application/json`

        4. On the **Body** tab, select **raw** and **JSON**, and specify the settings for the workflow:

           ```json
           {
               "name": "<name>",
               "source_id": "<source-connector-id>",
               "destination_id": "<destination-connector-id>",
               "workflow_type": "<type>",
               "schedule": "<schedule-timeframe>"
           }
           ```

        5. Click **Send**.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Replace the preceding placeholders as follows:

- `<name>` (_required_) - A unique name for this workflow.
- `<source-connector-id>` (_required_) - The ID of the target source connector. To get the ID, 
    use the `GET` method to call the `/sources` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#list-source-connectors).
- `<destination-connector-id>` (_required_) - The ID of the target destination connector. To get the ID, 
    use the `GET` method to call the `/destinations` endpoint. [Learn more](/platform/api/overview#list-destination-connectors).
- `<type>` (_required_) - The workflow optimization type. Available values include `advanced`, `basic`, and `platinum`.
- `<schedule-timeframe>` - The repeating automatic run schedule, specified as a predefined phrase. The available predefined phrases are:

  - `every 15 minutes`: Every 15 minutes (cron expression: `*/15 * * * *`).
  - `every hour`: At the first minute of every hour (cron expression: `0 * * * *`).
  - `every 2 hours`: At the first minute of every second hour (cron expression: `0 */2 * * *`).
  - `every 4 hours`: At the first minute of every fourth hour (cron expression: `0 */4 * * *`).
  - `every 6 hours`: At the first minute of every sixth hour (cron expression: `0 */6 * * *`).
  - `every 8 hours`: At the first minute of every eighth hour (cron expression: `0 */8 * * *`).
  - `every 10 hours`: At the first minute of every tenth hour (cron expression: `0 */10 * * *`).
  - `every 12 hours`: At the first minute of every twelfth hour (cron expression: `0 */12 * * *`).
  - `daily`: At the first minute of every day (cron expression: `0 0 * * *`).
  - `weekly`: At the first minute of every Sunday (cron expression: `0 0 * * 0`).
  - `monthly`: At the first minute of the first day of every month (cron expression: `0 0 1 * *`).
    
  If `schedule` is not specified, the workflow does not automatically run on a repeating schedule.

## Update a workflow

To update information about a workflow, use the `PUT` method to call the `/workflows/<workflow-id>` endpoint, replacing 
`<workflow-id>` with the workflow's unique ID. To get this ID, see [List workflows](#list-workflows).

In the request body, specify the settings for the workflow. For the specific settings to include, see 
[Create a workflow](/platform/api/workflows#create-a-workflow).

    <Accordion title="curl">
        ```bash
        curl --request 'PUT' --location \
        "$UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL/workflows/<workflow-id>" \

        --header 'accept: application/json' \
        --data \
        '{
            # Specify the settings for the workflow here.
        }'

            ```

        3. On the **Headers** tab, enter the following headers:

            - **Key**: `unstructured-api-key`, **Value**: `{{UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY}}`

        4. On the **Body** tab, select **raw** and **JSON**, and specify the settings for the workflow.
        5. Click **Send**.
