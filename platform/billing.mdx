## Add, view, or change pay-per-page payment details

After you sign up for a [pay-per-page](https://unstructured.io/developers#get-started) plan, 
after your first 14 days of usage or more than 1000 processed pages per day, whichever comes first, 
you must provide Unstructured with your payment details to continue using the service.
