## Jobs dashboard

![job dashboard](/img/platform/04a-Job-Dashboard.png)

To view the jobs dashboard, on the sidebar, click **Jobs**.

The jobs dashboard provides a centralized view for managing and monitoring the execution of data processing tasks within your workflows.

The jobs dashboard lists each job and its associated workflow's **Name**, **ID**, **Status**, and **Execution Start Time**.

Each job's status, shown in the **Status** column, can be:
    
*   **New**: The job has been created but has not yet run.
    
*   **Scheduled**: The job is set to run at a future date and time, as shown in the **Execution Start Time** column.
    
*   **Partitioning**: The job's documents are being processed.
    
*   **Finished**: The job has completed.
    
*   **Failed**: The job has some errors.

## Run a job

![create adhoc job](/img/platform/04b-Create-Adhoc-Job.png)

1.  On the sidebar, click **Jobs**, and then click **Run Job**.
    
2.  In the **Select a Workflow or create a new one** dropdown list, select an existing workflow, and then click **Run**.

3.  To create a new workflow for this job, in the **Select a Workflow or create a new one** dropdown list, click **New**. Fill in the following fields, and then click **Run**.
    
    *   **Sources**: The existing source connector for the job. This determines where to get the files to be processed. If you do not have an existing source connector, you must stop here, click **Close**, and create one. [Learn how](/platform/platform-source-connectors/overview).
        
    *   **Destination**: The existing destination connector for the job. This determines where the processed data will be sent. If you do not have an existing destination connector, you must stop here, click **Close**, and create one. [Learn how](/platform/platform-destination-connectors/overview).
        
    *   **Strategy**: Select the processing strategy for the data:

        *   **Auto** (default strategy): Chooses the partitioning strategy based on document characteristics and the function `kwargs`.
        
        *   **Fast**: Leverages traditional NLP extraction techniques to pull all text elements quickly. This strategy is not good for image-based file types.
        
        *   **Hi Res**: Uses the document layout to gain additional information about document elements. We recommend using this strategy if your use case is highly sensitive to correct classifications for document elements.
        
        *   **OCR Only**: Leverages Optical Character Recognition to extract text from the image-based files.

    *   **Settings**: Select one or more of the following boxes to enable these behaviors:
        
        *   **Include Page Breaks**: The output includes page breaks if the file type supports it. [Learn more](/api-reference/api-services/api-parameters#include-page-breaks).
            
        *   **Infer Table Structure**: Extract tables from PDFs or images.
            
        *   **Keep XML Tags**: The output retains the XML tags. This only applies to "partition\_xml". [Learn more](/api-reference/api-services/api-parameters#xml-keep-tags).
            
        *   **Reprocess all documents**: The workflow processes any previously processed documents.

        *   **Retry failed documents (on next run)**: The next time this workflow runs, the workflow attempts to reprocess any failed documents from the previous run.

## Monitor a job

The **Job Details** page is a comprehensive section for monitoring the specific details of jobs executed within a particular workflow. To access this page, click the specific **Workflow** or **ID** link on the jobs dashboard.

The **Job Details** page shows:

*   **Documents**: The number of documents by workflow status:

    *   **Documents**: The total number of documents included in the workflow.
        
    *   **New**: The number of new documents to be processed.
        
    *   **Partitioning**: The number of documents being processed.
        
    *   **Finished**: The number of documents that have completed.
        
    *   **Failed**: The number of documents that have failed to be processed.
        
*   Other information about the job, such as its overall **Status**, **Scheduled Execution Time**, **Sources**, and **Destinations**.

*   The job's activity logs. These logs are visible only while the job is running.
