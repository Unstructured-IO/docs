<Tip>
    To get help choosing and setting an embedding provider and model for your 
    [Custom](/platform/workflows#create-a-custom-workflow) workflows, 
    [request an embed recommendation from Unstructured](/platform/recommend).
</Tip>

After partitioning, chunking, and summarizing, the _embedding_ step creates arrays of numbers 
known as _vectors_, representing the text that is extracted by Unstructured. 
These vectors are stored or _embedded_ next to the text itself. These vector embeddings are generated by an 
[embedding model](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#embedding-models) that is provided by 
an _embedding provider_.

You typically save these embeddings in a _vector store_. 
When a user queries a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) application, the application can use a vector database to perform 
a [similarity search](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/what-is-similarity-search/) in that vector store 
and then return the items whose embeddings are the closest to that user's query.

Here is an example of a document element generated by Unstructured, along with its vector embeddings generated by 
the embedding model [sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

## Generate embeddings

To generate embeddings, choose one of the following embedding providers and models in the **Providers** section of an **Embedder** node in a workflow:

<Note>You can change a workflow's preconfigured provider only through [Custom](/platform/workflows#create-a-custom-workflow) workflow settings.</Note>

- **OpenAI**: Use [OpenAI](https://openai.com) to generate embeddings. Also, choose the model to use:

  - **text-embedding-3-small**, with 1536 dimensions.
  - **text-embedding-3-large**, with 3072 dimensions.
  - **Ada 002 (Text)**, with 1536 dimensions.
