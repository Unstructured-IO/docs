The jobs dashboard provides a centralized view for managing and monitoring the execution of data processing tasks within your workflows.

![Partially finished job icon](/img/platform/Job-Finished-Partially.png) **Finished**: 90% to 99% of the job's data has been sucessfully processed.
![Failed job icon](/img/platform/Job-Failed.png) **Failed**: Less than 90% of the job's data has been successfully processed.
