title: Partitioning
---

_Partitioning_ extracts content from raw unstructured files and outputs that content as structured [document elements](/platform/document-elements).

For specific file types, such as image files and PDF files, the Unstructured Platform offers special strategies to partition them. Each of these 
strategies has trade-offs for output speed, cost to output, and quality of output.

PDF files, for example, vary in quality and complexity. In simple cases, traditional natural language processing (NLP) extraction techniques might 
be enough to extract all the text out of a document. In other cases, advanced image-to-text models are required 
to process a PDF file. Some of these strategies implement rule-based workflows, which can be faster and cheaper, because they always 
extract in the same way, but you might sometimes get lower-quality resolution. Other strategies implement 
model-based workflows, which can be slower and costlier because they require a model that performs inference, but you can get higher-quality resolution. 
When you choose a partitioning strategy for your files, you should be mindful of these speed, cost, and quality trade-offs. 
For example, the **Fast** strategy can be about 100 times faster than leading image-to-text models.

To choose one of these strategies, select one of the **Strategy** options in the **Transform** section of a workflow:

- **High Res** (_default_): This strategy uses an image-to-text model for inference. It is slower and costlier than **Fast** but can provide 
  higher-quality resolution. You should choose this strategy if you know that:

  - All of the files are only image files, or
  - All of the files are only PDF files, and they have embedded images or tables in them, or
  - All of the files are a combination of only these two kinds of files.

- **Fast**: This strategy is rule-based. It is faster and cheaper than **High Res** but might provide lower-quality resolution. 
  You should choose this strategy if you know that:

  - You have only PDF files, and you know that none of them have embedded images or tables in them, or 
  - You have no PDF files or image files at all.

- **Auto**: This strategy leaves the choice of using **High Res** or **Fast** to Unstructured to determine on a file-by-file basis as it goes along. 
  Unstructured will use **High Res** if it can determine that the current file under analysis is an image file or a PDF file with embedded images or tables. 
  Otherwise, Unstructured will use **Fast** on the current file. 
  You should choose this strategy if you know that all of the files are a combination of:

  - At least one image file; or at least one PDF file with embedded images or tables in it; and any number of other kinds of files.

  Choosing **Auto** can be an effective choice with a reasonable balance of speed, cost, and quality 
  when you have a mixture of these types of files.
