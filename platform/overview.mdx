The Unstructured Platform is a no-code user interface, pay-as-you-go platform for transforming your unstructured data into data that is ready for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

## How does it work?

To get your data RAG-ready, the Unstructured Platform moves it through the following process:

```mermaid
  flowchart LR
    Connect[1. Connect]-->Route[2. Route]-->Transform[3. Transform]-->Chunk[4. Chunk]-->Enrich[5. Enrich]-->Embed[6. Embed]-->Persist[7. Persist]
```
<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect">
    The Unstructured Platform offers multiple [source connectors](/platform/sources/overview) to connect to your data in its existing location.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Route">
    Routing determines which strategy Unstructured Platform uses to transforming your documents into Unstructured's canonical JSON schema. The Unstructured Platform provides these [partitioning](/platform/partitioning) strategies for document transformation:
    
    - **Basic** / **Fast** is ideal for simple, text-only documents.
    - **Advanced** / **High Res** is best for PDFs, images, and complex file types.

      <Note>
          During **Advanced** / **High Res** processing, any detected text-based files are processed and billed at the **Basic** / **Fast** rate instead.
      </Note>

    - **Platinum** / **VLM** is for challenging documents, including scanned and handwritten content.

      <Note>
          During **Platinum** / **VLM** processing, any detected files that are not PDFs or images are processed and billed at either the **Advanced** / **High Res** or **Basic** / **Fast** rate instead. 
          Of those non-PDF and non-image files, all text-based files are processed and billed at the **Basic** / **Fast** rate instead. The other files are processed and billed at the **Advanced** / **High Res** rate instead.
      </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Transform"> 
    Your source document is transformed into Unstructured's canonical JSON schema. Regardless of the input document, this JSON schema we gives you a [standardized output](/platform/document-elements). It contains more than 20 elements, such as `Header`, `Footer`, `Title`, `NarrativeText`, `Table`, `Image`, and many more. Each document is wrapped in extensive metadata so you can understand languages, file types, sources, hierarchies, and much more.
  </Step>
    <Step title="Chunk"> 
    The Unstructured Platform provides these [chunking](/platform/chunking) strategies:
    
    - **Basic** combines sequential elements up to specified size limits. Oversized elements are split, while tables are isolated and divided if necessary. Overlap between chunks is optional.
    - **By Title** uses semantic chunking, understands the layout of the document, and makes intelligent splits.
    - **By Page** attempts to preserve page boundaries when determining the chunks' contents.
    - **By Similarity** uses an embedding model to identify topically similar sequential elements and combines them into chunks.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enrich">
    Images and tables can be optionally summarized. This generates enriched content around the images or tables that were parsed during the transformation process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Embed">
    The Unstructured Platform uses optional third-party [embedding](/platform/embedding) providers such as OpenAI.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Persist">
    The Unstructured Platform offers multiple [destination connectors](/platform/destinations/overview), including all major vector databases.
  </Step>
</Steps>

To simplify this process and provide it as a no-code solution, the Unstructured Platform brings together four key concepts:

```mermaid
  flowchart LR
    subgraph Workflow[3. Workflow]
        direction LR
        Source[1. Source Connector] --> Destination[2. Destination Connector]
    end
    Jobs
    Workflow[3. Workflow] --> Jobs[4. Jobs]
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Source Connector">
    [Source connectors](/platform/sources/overview) to ingest your data into the Unstructured Platform for transformation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Destination Connector">
    [Destination connectors](/platform/destinations/overview) tell the Unstructured Platform where to write your transformed data to.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Workflow">
    [Workflows](/platform/workflows) connect sources to destinations and provide chunking, embedding, and scheduling options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Jobs">
    [Jobs](/platform/jobs) enable you to monitor data transformation progress.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What support is there for compliance?

The platform is designed for global reach with SOC2 Type 1, SOC2 Type 2, and HIPAA compliance. It has support for over 50 languages.
