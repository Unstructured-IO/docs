## Workflows dashboard

![Workflows in the sidebar](/img/platform/Workflows-Sidebar.png)

To view the workflows dashboard, on the sidebar, click **Workflows**.

A workflow in the Unstructured Platform is a defined sequence of processes that automate the data handling from source to destination. It allows users to configure how and when data should be ingested, processed, and stored.

Workflows are crucial for establishing a systematic approach to managing data flows within the platform, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and adherence to specific data processing requirements.

## Create a workflow

![Choose a workflow type](/img/platform/Choose-Workflow-Type.png)

The Unstructured Platform provides two types of workflow builders:

- [Automatic](#create-an-automatic-workflow) workflows, which use sensible default workflow settings to enable you to get good-quality results faster.
- [Custom](#create-a-custom-worklow) workflows, which enable you to fine-tune the workflow settings behind the scenes to get very specific results.

All Unstructured accounts can create automatic worklows.

To create custom workflows, you must request Unstructured to enable your account first. [Learn how](#create-a-custom-worklow).

### Create an automatic workflow

<Warning>
    You must first have an existing source connector and destination connector to add to the workflow.

    If you do not have an existing connector for either your target source (input) or destination (output) location, [create the source connector](/platform/sources/overview), [create the destination connector](/platform/destinations/overview), and then return here.

    To see your existing connectors, on the sidebar, click **Connectors**, and then click **Sources** or **Destinations**.
</Warning>

To create an automatic workflow:

1. On the sidebar, click **Workflows**.
2. Click **New Workflow**.
3. Next to **Build it with me**, click **Create Workflow**.

   <Note>If a radio button appears instead of **Build it with me**, select it, and then click **Continue**.</Note>

4. For **Workflow Name**, enter some unique name for this workflow.
5. In the **Sources** dropdown list, select your source location.
6. In the **Destinations** dropdown list, select your destination location.

   <Note>You can select multiple source and destination locations. Files will be ingested from all of the selected source locations, and the processed data will be delivered to all of the selected destination locations.</Note>

7. Click **Continue**.
8. In the **Optimize for** section, select the option to choose one of these predefined workflow settings groups:

   - **Basic** is a good choice if you have text-only documents that have no images or tables in them.
   - **Advanced** is a good choice if you have complex documents that have images or tables or both in them.
   - **Platinum** provides the highest accuracy for parsing image and PDF files by using visual language models (VLMs). Files that are not images or PDFs are processed by using the **Advanced** option and are charged at the **Advanced** rate instead.

9. The **Reprocess all** box applies only to the Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage source connectors:

   - Checking this box reprocesses all documents in the source location on every workflow run.
   - Unchecking this box causes only new documents that are added to the source location since the last workflow run to be processed on future runs. Previously processed documents are not processed again, even if those documents' contents change.

10. If you want to retry processing any documents that failed to process, check the **Retry Failed Documents** box.
11. Click **Continue**.
12. If you want this workflow to run on a schedule, in the **Repeat Run** dropdown list, select one of the scheduling options, and fill in the scheduling settings. Otherwise, select **Don't repeat**.
13. Click **Complete**.
14. If you did not set the workflow to run on a schedule, you can [run the worklow](#edit-delete-or-run-a-workflow) now.

### Create a custom workflow

<Warning>
    You must first have an existing source connector and destination connector to add to the workflow.

    If you do not have an existing connector for either your target source (input) or destination (output) location, [create the source connector](/platform/sources/overview), [create the destination connector](/platform/destinations/overview), and then return here.

    To see your existing connectors, on the sidebar, click **Connectors**, and then click **Sources** or **Destinations**.
</Warning>

There are two ways to create a custom workflow:

- Through [Build it with me > Custom](#build-it-with-me-custom). This option enables you to fine-tune the kinds of settings that are in **Basic**, **Advanced**, and **Platinum**.
- Through [Build it myself](#build-it-myself). This option offers a visual workflow designer with even more fine-tuning than the **Custom** option.  

#### Build it with me - Custom

1. On the sidebar, click **Workflows**.
2. Click **New Workflow**.
3. Next to **Build it with me**, click **Create Workflow**.

   <Note>If a radio button appears instead of **Build it with me**, select it, and then click **Continue**.</Note>

4. For **Workflow Name**, enter some unique name for this workflow.
5. In the **Sources** dropdown list, select your source location.
6. In the **Destinations** dropdown list, select your destination location.

   <Note>You can select multiple source and destination locations. Files will be ingested from all of the selected source locations, and the processed data will be delivered to all of the selected destination locations.</Note>

7. Click **Continue**.
8. In the **Optimize for** section, click the **Custom** option, and then click **Continue**.

   <Note>
      If the **Custom** option is disabled, inside the **Custom** option click **Notify me**, and follow the on-screen directions to complete the request. 
      Unstructured will notify you when your account has been enabled with the **Custom** option. After you receive this notification, click the 
      **Custom** option, and then click **Continue**.
   </Note>

9. In the **Strategy** area, choose one of the following:

    - **Fast**: This strategy uses traditional NLP extraction techniques to quickly pull in all text elements. This strategy is not good for image-based file types or files with images or tables in them.
    - **Hi-res**: This strategy uses the document layout to gain additional information about document elements. This strategy is good for image-based file types and files with images or tables in them. This strategy is recommended if your use case is highly sensitive to correct classification for document elements.
    - **VLM**: This strategy provides the highest accuracy for parsing image and PDF files by using visual language models (VLMs).
    - **Auto**: This strategy chooses the partitioning strategy on a file-by-file basis, depending on detected document characteristics.

    [Learn more](/platform/partitioning).

10. In the **Image Summzarizer** drop-down list, choose one of the following:

    - **None**: Do not provide summaries for any detected images in any of the files.
    - **GPT-4o**: Use GPT-4o to provide summaries for any detected images in any of the files. [Learn more](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/).
    - **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet to provide summaries for any detected images in any of the files. [Learn more](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet).

    [Learn more](/platform/summarizing).

11. In the **Table Summzarizer** drop-down list, choose one of the following:

    - **None**: Do not provide summaries for any detected tables in any of the files.
    - **GPT-4o**: Use GPT-4o to provide summaries for any detected tables in any of the files. [Learn more](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/).
    - **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet to provide summaries for any detected tables in any of the files. [Learn more](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet).

    [Learn more](/platform/summarizing).

12. Check the **Include Page Breaks** box to include page breaks in the output, if the file type support it.
13. Check the **Infer Table Structure** box to extract any detected table elements in PDF files as HTML format into a `metadata` output field named `text_as_html`.

14. In the **Elements to Exclude** drop-down list, select any element types to exclude from the output.
15. In the **Chunk** area, for **Chunker Type**, select one of the following:

    - **None**: Do not apply special chunking rules to the output.
    - **Chunk by Character** (also known as _basic_ chunking): Combine sequential elements to maximally fill each chunk. Also, specify the following:

      - **Include Original Elements**: Check this box to output the elements that were used to form a chunk, to appear in the `metadata` field's `orig_elements` field for that chunk. By default, this box is unchecked.
      - **Max Characters**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. The default is **2048**.
      - **New After n chars**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. This is an approximate limit. The default is **1500**.
      - **Overlap**: Apply a prefix of this many trailing characters from the prior text-split chunk to second and later chunks formed from oversized elements by text-splitting. The default is **160**.
      - **Overlap all**: Check this box to apply overlap to "normal" chunks formed by combining whole elements. Use with caution as this can introduce noise into otherwise clean semantic units. By default, this box is unchecked.
        
    - **Chunk by Page**: Preserve page boundaries. When a new page is detected, the existing chunk is closed and a new one is started, even if the next element would fit in the prior chunk. Also, specify the following:
        
      - **Include Original Elements**: Check this box to output the elements that were used to form a chunk, to appear in the `metadata` field's `orig_elements` field for that chunk. By default, this box is unchecked.
      - **Max Characters**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. This is a strict limit. The default is **500**.
      - **New After n Characters**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. This is an approximate limit. The default is **50**.
      - **Overlap**: Apply a prefix of this many trailing characters from the prior text-split chunk to second and later chunks formed from oversized elements by text-splitting. The default is **30**.
      - **Overlap all**: Check this box to apply overlap to "normal" chunks formed by combining whole elements. Use with caution as this can introduce noise into otherwise clean semantic units. By default, this box is unchecked.

    - **Chunk by Title**: Preserve section boundaries and optionally page boundaries as well. A single chunk will never contain text that occurred in two different sections. When a new section starts, the existing chunk is closed and a new one is started, even if the next element would fit in the prior chunk. Also, specify the following:
    
      - **Combine Text Under n Chars**: Combine elements until a section reaches a length of this many characters. The default is **0**.
      - **Include Original Elements**: Check this box to output the elements that were used to form a chunk, to appear in the `metadata` field's `orig_elements` field for that chunk. By default, this box is unchecked.
      - **Max Characters**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. This is a strict limit. The default is **2048**.
      - **Multipage Sections**: Check this box to allow sections to span multiple pages. By default, this box is unchecked.
      - **New After n Characters**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. This is an approximate limit. The default is **1500*.
      - **Overlap**: Apply a prefix of this many trailing characters from the prior text-split chunk to second and later chunks formed from oversized elements by text-splitting. The default is **160**.
      - **Overlap all**: Check this box to apply overlap to "normal" chunks formed by combining whole elements. Use with caution as this can introduce noise into otherwise clean semantic units. By default, this box is unchecked.

    - **Chunk by Similarity**: Use the [sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1) embedding model to identify topically similar sequential elements and combine them into chunks. Also, specify the following:

      - **Include Original Elements**: Check this box to output the elements that were used to form a chunk, to appear in the `metadata` field's `orig_elements` field for that chunk. By default, this box is unchecked.
      - **Max Characters**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. This is a strict limit. The default is **500**.
      - **Similarity Threshold**: Specify a threshold between 0 and 1 exclusive (0.01 to 0.99 inclusive), where 0 indicates completely dissimilar vectors and 1 indicates identical vectors, taking into consider the trade-offs between precision (a higher threshold) and recall (a lower threshold). The default is **0.5**. [Learn more](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-embedding-clustering-and-similarity-11dd80b00061).

## Edit, delete, or run a workflow

To run a workflow:

1. On the sidebar, click **Workflows**.
2. In the list of workflows, click **Run** in the row for the workflow that you want to run.

For each of the workflows on the **Workflows** list page, the following actions are available by clicking the ellipses (the three dots) in the row for the respective workflow:

*   **Edit via Form**: Changes the existing configuration of your workflow.
*   **Delete**: Removes the workflow from the platform. Use this action cautiously, as it will permanently delete the workflow and its configurations.
*   **Open**: Opens the workflow's settings page.
