To view the workflows dashboard, on the sidebar, click **Workflows**.

A workflow in the Unstructured Platform is a defined sequence of processes that automate the data handling from source to destination. It allows users to configure how and when data should be ingested, processed, and stored.

Workflows are crucial for establishing a systematic approach to managing data flows within the platform, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and adherence to specific data processing requirements.

## Create a workflow

![Choose a workflow type](/img/platform/Choose-Workflow-Type.png)

The Unstructured Platform provides two ways to create a workflow:

- An [automatic workflow](#create-an-automatic-workflow) or "build it for me" workflow. Automatic workflows use sensible process defaults to enable you to get good-quality results faster.
- A [custom workflow](#create-a-custom-worklow) or "build it myself" workflow. Custom workflows enable you to fine-tune the process behind the scenes, and you are okay with spending some extra setup time to get very specific results.

All Unstructured accounts can create automatic worklows.

To create custom workflows, you must request Unstructured to enable your account first. [Learn how](#create-a-custom-worklow).

### Create an automatic workflow

<Warning>
    You must first have an existing source connector and destination connector to add to the workflow.

    If you do not have an existing connector for either your target source (input) or destination (output) location, [create the source connector](/platform/sources/overview), [create the destination connector](/platform/destinations/overview), and then return here.

    To see your existing connectors, on the sidebar, click **Connectors**, and then click **Sources** or **Destinations**.
</Warning>

To create an automatic workflow:

1. On the sidebar, click **Workflows**.
2. Click **New Workflow**.
3. Next to **Build it for me**, click **Create Workflow**.

   <Info>
       If your Unstructured account is enabled for custom workflows, select the option button next to **Build it for me**, 
       and then click **Continue**.
   </Info>

4. For **Workflow Name**, enter some unique name for this workflow.
5. In the **Sources** dropdown list, select your source location.
6. In the **Destinations** dropdown list, select your destination location.

   <Note>You can select multiple source and destination locations. Files will be ingested from all of the selected source locations, and the processed data will be delivered to all of the selected destination locations.</Note>

7. Click **Continue**.
8. If you want this workflow to run on a schedule, in the **Repeat run** dropdown list, select one of the scheduling options, and fill in the scheduling settings. Otherwise, select **Don't repeat**.
9. Click **Continue**.
10. In the **Strategy Focus** section, choose one of these predefined workflow settings groups:

    - **Basic** is a good choice if you have text-only documents that have no images or tables in them.
    - **Advanced** is a good choice if you have complex documents that have images or tables or both in them.
           
11. Click **Complete**.

### Create a custom workflow

<Warning>
    You must first have an existing source connector and destination connector to add to the workflow.

    If you do not have an existing connector for either your target source (input) or destination (output) location, [create the source connector](/platform/sources/overview), [create the destination connector](/platform/destinations/overview), and then return here.

    To see your existing connectors, on the sidebar, click **Connectors**, and then click **Sources** or **Destinations**.
</Warning>

To create custom workflows, you must request Unstructured to enable your account first. To make this request:

1. On the sidebar, click **Workflows**.
2. Click **New Workflow**.
3. Next to **Build it myself**, click **Notify me**, and follow the on-screen directions to complete the request.
4. Unstructured will notify you when your account has been enabled to create custom workflows.

After Unstructured notifies you that your account has been enabled to create custom workflows:

1. On the sidebar, click **Workflows**.
2. Click **New Workflow**.
3. Select the option button next to **Build it myself**, and then click **Continue**.
4. In the **This workflow** pane, click the **Details** button.

   ![Workflow details](/img/platform/Workflow-Details.png)

5. Next to **Name**, click the pencil icon, enter some unique name for this workflow, and then click the check mark icon.
6. If you want this workflow to run on a schedule, click the **Schedule** button. In the **Repeat Run** dropdown list, select one of the scheduling options, and fill in the scheduling settings.
7. To overwrite any previously processed files, or to retry any documents that fail to process, click the **Settings** button, and check either or both of the boxes.
8. In the pipeline designer, click the **Source** node. In the **Source** pane, select the source location. Then click **Save**.

   ![Workflow designer](/img/platform/Workflow-Designer.png)

9. Click the **Destination** node. In the **Destination** pane, select the destination location. Then click **Save**.
10. As needed, add more nodes by clicking the plus icon or **Add Node** button:

    ![Add node to workflow](/img/platform/Workflow-Add-Node.png)

    - Click **Connect** to add another **Source** or **Destination** node. You can add multiple source and destination locations. Files will be ingested from all of the source locations, and the processed data will be delivered to all of the destination locations. [Learn more](#custom-workflow-node-types).
    - Click **Enrich** to add a **Chunker** or **Enrichment** node. [Learn more](#custom-workflow-node-types).
    - Click **Transform** to add a **Partitioner** or **Embedder** node. [Learn more](#custom-workflow-node-types).

    To edit a node, click that node, and then change its settings.

    To delete a node, click that node, and then click the trash can icon above it.

11. Click **Save**.

#### Custom workflow node types

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Partitioner node">
        For **Partition Strategy**, choose one of the following:

        - **Auto**: This strategy chooses the partitioning strategy based on detected document characteristics. [Learn more](/platform/partitioning).
        - **Fast**: This strategy uses traditional NLP extraction techniques to quickly pull in all text elements. This strategy is not good for image-based file types. [Learn more](/platform/partitioning).
        - **Hi-res**: This strategy uses document layout to gain additional information about document elements. Unstructured recommends using this strategy if your use case is highly sensitive to correct classifications for document elements. [Learn more](/platform/partitioning).
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Chunker node">
        For **Chunkers**, select one of the following:

        - **Chunk by title**: Preserve section boundaries and optionally page boundaries as well. A single chunk will never contain text that occurred in two different sections. When a new section starts, the existing chunk is closed and a new one is started, even if the next element would fit in the prior chunk. [Learn more](/api-reference/api-services/chunking). Also specify the following:
        
          - **Combine text under n chars**: Combine elements until a section reaches a length of this many characters. The default is **0**.
          - **Include original elements**: Check this box to output the elements that were used to form a chunk, to appear in the `metadata` field's `orig_elements` field for that chunk. By default, this box is unchecked.
          - **Max characters**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. This is a strict limit. The default is **2048**.
          - **Multipage sections**: Check this box to allow sections to span multiple pages. By default, this box is unchecked.
          - **New after n chars**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. This is an approximate limit. The default is **1500*.
          - **Overlap**: Apply a prefix of this many trailing characters from the prior text-split chunk to second and later chunks formed from oversized elements by text-splitting. The default is **160**.
          - **Overlap all**: Check this box to apply overlap to "normal" chunks formed by combining whole elements. Use with caution as this can introduce noise into otherwise clean semantic units. By default, this box is unchecked.

        - **Chunk by character** (also known as _basic_ chunking): Combine sequential elements to maximally fill each chunk. [Learn more](/platform/chunking). Also specify the following:

          - **Include original elements**: Check this box to output the elements that were used to form a chunk, to appear in the `metadata` field's `orig_elements` field for that chunk. By default, this box is unchecked.
          - **Max characters**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. The default is **2048**.
          - **New after n chars**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. This is an approximate limit. The default is **1500*.
          - **Overlap**: Apply a prefix of this many trailing characters from the prior text-split chunk to second and later chunks formed from oversized elements by text-splitting. The default is **160**.
          - **Overlap All**: Check this box to apply overlap to "normal" chunks formed by combining whole elements. Use with caution as this can introduce noise into otherwise clean semantic units. By default, this box is unchecked.
        
        - **Chunk by page**: Preserve page boundaries. When a new page is detected, the existing chunk is closed and a new one is started, even if the next element would fit in the prior chunk. [Learn more](/platform/chunking). Also specify the following:
        
          - **Include original elements**: Check this box to output the elements that were used to form a chunk, to appear in the `metadata` field's `orig_elements` field for that chunk. By default, this box is unchecked.
          - **Max characters**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. This is a strict limit. The default is **500**.
          - **New after n chars**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. This is an approximate limit. The default is **50**.
          - **Overlap**: Apply a prefix of this many trailing characters from the prior text-split chunk to second and later chunks formed from oversized elements by text-splitting. The default is **30**.
          - **Overlap all**: Check this box to apply overlap to "normal" chunks formed by combining whole elements. Use with caution as this can introduce noise into otherwise clean semantic units. By default, this box is unchecked.
        
        - **Chunk by similarity**: Use the [sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1) embedding model to identify topically similar sequential elements and combine them into chunks. [Learn more](/platform/chunking). Also specify the following:

          - **Include original elements**: Check this box to output the elements that were used to form a chunk, to appear in the `metadata` field's `orig_elements` field for that chunk. By default, this box is unchecked.
          - **Max characters**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. This is a strict limit. The default is **500**.
          - **Similarity threshold**: Specify a threshold between 0 and 1 exclusive (0.01 to 0.99 inclusive), where 0 indicates completely dissimilar vectors and 1 indicates identical vectors, taking into consider the trade-offs between precision (a higher threshold) and recall (a lower threshold). The default is **0.5**. [Learn more](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-embedding-clustering-and-similarity-11dd80b00061).
