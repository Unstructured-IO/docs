_Enriching_ adds enhancments to the processed data that Unstructured produces. These enrichments include:

- Providing a summarized description of the contents of a detected image. [Learn more](/platform/enriching/image-descriptions).
- Providing a summarized description of the contents of a detected table. [Learn more](/platform/enriching/table-descriptions).
- Providing a representation of a detected table in HTML markup format. [Learn more](/platform/enriching/table-to-html).

To add an enrichment, in the **Task** drop-down list of an **Enrichment** node in a workflow, select one of the following enrichment types:

<Note>
    You can change a workflow's table description settings only through [Custom](/platform/workflows#create-a-custom-workflow) workflow settings.

    Enrichments work only when the **Partitioner** node in a workflow is also set to use the **High Res** partitioning strategy. [Learn more](/platform/partitioning).

- **Image Description** to provide a summarized description of the contents of each detected image. [Learn more](/platform/enriching/image-descriptions).
- **Table Description** to provide a summarized description of the contents of each detected table.  [Learn more](/platform/enriching/table-descriptions).
- **Table to HTML** to provide a representation of each detected table in HTML markup format. [Learn more](/platform/enriching/table-to-html).

To add multiple enrichments, create an additional **Enrichment** node for each enrichment type that you want to add.
