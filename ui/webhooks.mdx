title: Webhooks
---

A _webhook_ is a common technique that allows a _sender_ to automatically send data to a _receiver_ based on events that happen in the sender. For Unstructured webhooks, Unstructured is the sender, 
and your solution is the receiver. Some popular receivers include 
[AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/urls-webhook-tutorial.html), 
[Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook), 
[Google Cloud Run](https://docs.cloud.google.com/run/docs/triggering/webhooks), 
[Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/what-are-webhooks/), 
[Slack](https://docs.slack.dev/messaging/sending-messages-using-incoming-webhooks/), 
[Svix](https://svix.com), and 
[Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/).

Your solution provides a unique URL, called the 
_webhook URL_, to receive the data that Unstructured sends. 
Behind the scenes, when specific events happen in Unstructured, Unstructured then automatically calls the webhook URL and 
passes to this webhook URL payloads of data in JSON format related to those events. The receiver then processes these payloads and can decide 
what to do with the data from there.

Because webhooks are event-driven, some event must first be triggered to begin generating the related data to be sent. In 
Unstructured, these webhooks can be triggered whenever a [job](/ui/jobs) that is associated with its target [workflow](/ui/workflows) does 
one or more of the following:

- Is scheduled to start running later (in the user interface, **Job scheduled**)
- Has begun running  (**Job in progress**)
- Has stopped running (**Job stopped**)
- Has failed to successfully complete (**Job failed**)
- Has successfully completed (**Job completed**) 

Unstructured webhooks can be created and managed at the following levels:

- At the **workspace** level. This allows any job that is associated with any 
  workspace in an Unstructured account to trigger the webhook. This can be useful for example for routing pager requests to a team of on-call engineers in an 
  IT operations center whenever any job fails across the workspace.

  <Note>
    Each **Let's Go** or **Pay-As-You-Go** account has one and only one workspace.

    An Unstructured **Business** account can have multiple workspaces.

    Workspace-level webhooks can be created, viewed, and managed with the 
    Unstructured user interface (UI) ([learn how](#create-a-workspace-level-webhook)) or with the 
    Unstructured API ([learn how](/api-reference/webhooks)).
  </Note>

- At the **workflow** level. This allows any job that is associated only with 
  the target workflow to trigger the webhook. This can be useful for example for emailing a department's data analyst that a long-running job for a specific workflow 
  has now completed, allowing them to begin working with the latest output.

  <Note>
    Workflow-level webhooks can be created, viewed, and managed only with the 
    Unstructured API. [Learn how](/api-reference/webhooks).
  </Note>

Whenever a webhook is triggered, the act of Unstructured sending the event data payload to a receiver is called a 
_notification_. You can get a count or a list of these notifications. You can also mark them in your Unstructured account as read after 
you have processed them according to your organization's needs. Marking a notification as read can help you keep track of 
which notifications you have already dealt with and which ones you still need to take action on.

<Note>
  Notifications can be created, viewed, and managed only with the Unstructured API. [Learn how](/api-reference/webhooks).

## Create a workspace-level webhook

To create a webhook that sends notifications for all specified events that happen across a workspace, regardless of the 
resource that triggers the event, do the following:

1. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your Unstructured account.
2. Open your target workspace as follows:

   - If you have an Unstructured **Let's Go** or **Pay-As-You-Go** account, your one and only workspace is already opened by default. 
     Skip ahead to Step 3.
   - If you have an Unstructured **Business** account, and you have not already opened the target workspace, select it now 
     ([learn how](/ui/account/workspaces#access-a-workspace)).
     
3. Click the **Webhooks** tab.
4. Click **Add Webhook +**.
5. In the **Webhook Setup** dialog, for **Webhook URL**, enter the target receiver's webhook URL.
6. Optionally, for **Description**, enter a meaningful description of the webhook, for your own reference.
7. For **Select Events**, click one or more of the available events that you want to Unstructured to send a notification for. 
   For more information about the list of available events, see this article's introductory section.
8. Click **Save Webhook**.

The new webhook is created and appears in the list of available webhooks.

## Change a workspace-level webhook's settings

To change the settings for an existing webhook that sends notifications for all specified events that happen across a workspace, do the following:

1. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your Unstructured account.
2. Open your target workspace as follows:

   - If you have an Unstructured **Let's Go** or **Pay-As-You-Go** account, your one and only workspace is already opened by default. 
     Skip ahead to Step 3.
   - If you have an Unstructured **Business** account, and you have not already opened the target workspace, select it now 
     ([learn how](/ui/account/workspaces#access-a-workspace)).
     
3. Click the **Webhooks** tab.
4. In the list of available webhooks, click the name of the webhook you want to change the settings for.
5. In the webhook's settings pane, make the desired changes. 
6. When you are done making your changes, click **Save Changes**.

The webhook's settings are updated, and the new settings begin taking effect.

## Delete a workspace-level webhook

<Warning>
  Deleting a webhook is a permanent action and is not recoverable.
</Warning>

To delete an existing webhook that sends notifications for all specified events that happen across a workspace, do the following:

1. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your Unstructured account.
2. Open your target workspace as follows:

   - If you have an Unstructured **Let's Go** or **Pay-As-You-Go** account, your one and only workspace is already opened by default. 
     Skip ahead to Step 3.
   - If you have an Unstructured **Business** account, and you have not already opened the target workspace, select it now 
     ([learn how](/ui/account/workspaces#access-a-workspace)).
     
3. Click the **Webhooks** tab.
4. In the list of available webhooks, click the name of the webhook you want to delete.
5. In the webhook's settings pane, click **Delete Webhook**.

The webhook is deleted, and notifications will no longer be sent for this webhook.
