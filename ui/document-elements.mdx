When Unstructured [partitions](/ui/partitioning) a file, the result is a list of _document elements_, sometimes referred to simply as _elements_. These elements represent different components of the source file. 

## Element example

Here's an example of what an element might look like:

```json
{
    "type": "NarrativeText",
    "element_id": "5ef1d1117721f0472c1ad825991d7d37",
    "text": "The Unstructured documentation covers the following services:",
    "metadata": {
        "last_modified": "2024-05-01T14:15:22",
        "page_number": 1,
        "languages": ["eng"],
        "parent_id": "56f24319ae258b735cac3ec2a271b1d9",
        "file_directory": "/content",
        "filename": "Unstructured documentation.html",
        "filetype": "text/html"
    }
}
```

Every element has a [type](#element-type); an [element_id](#element-id); the extracted `text`; and some [metadata](#metadata) which might 
vary depending on the element type, file structure, and some additional settings that are applied during 
[partitioning](/ui/partitioning), [chunking](/ui/chunking), and [enriching](/ui/enriching/overview). Optionally, the element can also have an 
[embeddings](/ui/embedding) derived from the `text`; the length of `embeddings` depends on the embedding model that is used.

## Element type

Instead of treating all files as strings of plain text, Unstructured preserves the semantic structure of the files. 
This gives you more control and flexibility over how you further use the processed files and allows you to take their 
structure into consideration. At the same time, normalizing data from various file formats to the Unstructured element 
type scheme lets you treat all files the same in your downstream processing, regardless of source format. 
For example, if you plan to summarize a file, you might only be interested in the narrative 
of the file and not care about its headers and footers. You can easily filter out the elements you don't need by specifying their type.

Here are some examples of the element types your file might contain:

| Element type        | Description                                                                                                                                          |

| `UncategorizedText` | Base element for capturing free text from within files. Applies to extracted text not associated with bounding boxes if the input is a PDF file.     |

If you apply chunking, you will also see the `CompositeElement` type. 
`CompositeElement` is a chunk formed from text (non-`Table`) elements. 
A composite element might be formed by combining one or more sequential elements produced by partitioning. For example, 
several individual list items might be combined into a single chunk.

For the most up-to-date list of available element types, see the `TYPE_TO_TEXT_ELEMENT_MAP` type-annotated mapping definition and the 
`ElementType` class definition in the [elements.py](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/blob/main/unstructured/documents/elements.py) 
file, located in the [Unstructured-IO/unstructured](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured) 
repository in GitHub.

## Element ID

By default, the element ID is a SHA-256 hash of the element's text, its position on the page, the page number it's on, 
and the name of the related file. This is to ensure that the ID is deterministic and unique at the file level.

## Metadata

Unstructured tracks a variety of metadata about the elements extracted from files. Metadata is tracked at the element level within `metadata`.

Element metadata enables you to do things such as:

* Filter file elements based on an element's metadata value. For instance, you might want to limit your scope to elements from a certain page, or you might want to use only elements that have an email matching a regular expression in their metadata.
* Map an element to the page where it occurred so that the original page can be retrieved when that element matches search criteria.

For the most up-to-date list of all available metadata fields, see the 
`ElementMetadata` class definition in the [elements.py](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/blob/main/unstructured/documents/elements.py) 
file, located in the [Unstructured-IO/unstructured](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured) 
repository in GitHub.

### Common metadata fields

All file types return the following `metadata` fields when the information is available from the source file:

| Metadata field name        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `category_depth`           | The depth of the element relative to other elements of the same category. Category depth is the depth of an element relative to other elements of the same category. It is set by a file partitioner and enables the [document hierarchy](#document-hierarchy) after processing to compute more accurate hierarchies. Category depth might be set using native document hierarchies, for example reflecting `<H1>` or `<H2>` tags within an HTML file or the indentation level of a bulleted list item in a Word document. |
| `coordinates`              | Any X-Y bounding box [coordinates](#element-coordinates).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `detection_class_prob`     | The detection model class probabilities. Applies only to Unstructured inference using the **High Res** strategy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `emphasized_text_contents` | The related emphasized text (bold or italic) in the original file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Notes on common metadata fields:

#### Document hierarchy

`parent_id` and `category_depth` enhance hierarchy detection to identify the document 
structure in various file formats by measuring relative depth of an element within its category. This is especially 
useful in files with native hierarchies like HTML or Word files, where elements like headings or list items inherently define structure.

#### Element coordinates

Some file types support location data for the elements, usually in the form of bounding boxes. 

The `coordinates` metadata field contains:

- `points` : These specify the corners of the bounding box starting from the top left corner and proceeding counter-clockwise. The points represent pixels, the origin is in the top left and the `y` coordinate increases in the downward direction.
- `system`: The points have an associated coordinate system. A typical example of a coordinate system is `PixelSpace`, which is used for representing the coordinates of images. The coordinate system has a name, orientation, layout width, and layout height.

Here are some notes on additional metadata fields by file type:

#### Email

For emails, metadata will contain the following fields, where available:

- `bcc_recipient`
- `cc_recipient`
- `email_message_id`
- `sent_from`
- `sent_to`
- `signature`
- `subject` 

`sent_from` is a list of strings because the [RFC 822](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc822) spec for emails allows for multiple sent from email addresses.

#### Microsoft Excel files

For Excel files, metadata will contain a `page_name` element, which corresponds to the sheet name in the Excel
file.

#### Microsoft Word files

Headers and footers in Word files include a `header_footer_type` indicating which page a header or footer applies to.
Valid values are `"primary"`, `"even_only"`, and `"first_page"`.

### Table-specific metadata

For `Table` elements, the raw text of the table will be stored in the `text` attribute for the element, and HTML representation
of the table will be available in the element metadata under `text_as_html`. 
Unstructured will automatically extract all tables for all doc types if you check the **Infer Table Structure** in the **ConnectorSettings** area of the **Transform** section of a workflow.

Here's an example of a table element. The `text` of the element will look like this (line breaks are added here for readability):

```text
Dataset Base Model1 Large Model Notes 
PubLayNet [38] F / M M Layouts of modern scientific documents 
PRImA [3] M - Layouts of scanned modern magazines and scientific reports 
Newspaper [17] F - Layouts of scanned US newspapers from the 20th century 
TableBank [18] F F Table region on modern scientific and business document 
HJDataset [31] F / M - Layouts of history Japanese documents
```

And the `text_as_html` metadata for the same element will look like this (line breaks are added here for readability):

```html
<table>
    <thead>
        <th>Dataset</th>
        <th>| Base Model’</th>
        <th>| Notes</th>
    </thead>
    <tr>
        <td>PubLayNet</td>
        <td>[38] F/M</td>
        <td>Layouts of modern scientific documents</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>PRImA [3]</td>
        <td>M</td>
        <td>Layouts of scanned modern magazines and scientific reports</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Newspaper</td>
        <td>F</td>
        <td>Layouts of scanned US newspapers from the 20th century</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>TableBank</td>
        <td>F</td>
        <td>Table region on modern scientific and business document</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>HJDataset [31]</td>
        <td>F/M</td>
        <td>Layouts of history Japanese documents</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

### Data connector metadata fields

Documents can include additional file metadata, based on the specified source connector.

#### Common data connector metadata fields

- `date_created`
- `date_modified`
- `date_processed`
- `permissions_data`
- `record_locator`
- `url`
- `version`

#### Additional metadata fields by connector type (within record_locator)

| Source connector | Additional metadata                                  |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Astra DB         | `document_id`                                        | 
| Confluence       | `document_id`, `space_id`                            |
| Discord          | `channel_id`                                         |

| Jira             | `id`, `key`                                          | 
| MongoDB          | `collection`, `database`, `document_id`              |
| Notion           | `database_id` (for databases), `page_id` (for pages) |
| OpenSearch       | `hosts`                                              |
| S3               | `protocol`, `remote_file_path`                       | 
| SharePoint       | `server_relative_path`, `user_pname`                 |

### VLM generated HTML elements

The vision language model (VLM) [partitioner](/ui/partitioning) also generates an HTML representation of the Unstructured elements that are produced. 
Unstructured has developed an element ontology that assigns incoming Unstructured elements to these various defined element ontology types. 
These element ontology types are used to generate standard HTML elements with the element ontology type as class attributes on 
those HTML elements. The generated HTML elements 
are output as `text_as_html` along with their `parent_id` in `metadata`, to allow for easier HTML reconstruction of the entire document as needed.

For example, given the following table element produced with the VLM partitioner, the `text_as_html` field is an HTML representation of the 
derived table, and `parent_id` is the `element_id` of the Unstructured element for the page that contains this table. (Line breaks are added here to the 
`text` and `text_as_html` fields for readability.)
