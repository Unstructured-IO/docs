title: Embedding
---

After partitioning, chunking, and summarizing, the _embedding_ step creates arrays of numbers 
known as _vectors_, representing the text that is extracted by Unstructured. 
These vectors are stored or _embedded_ next to the text itself. These vector embeddings are generated by an 
[embedding model](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#embedding-models) that is provided by 
an _embedding provider_.

You typically save these embeddings in a _vector store_. 
When a user queries a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) application, the application can use a vector database to perform 
a [similarity search](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/what-is-similarity-search/) in that vector store 
and then return the items whose embeddings are the closest to that user's query.

Here is an example of a document element generated by Unstructured, along with its vector embeddings generated by 
the embedding model [sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

## Generate embeddings

To generate embeddings, choose one of the available embedding providers and models in the **Select Embedding Model** section of an **Embedder** node in a workflow.

When choosing an embedding model, be sure to pay attention to the number of dimensions listed next to each model. This number must match the number of dimensions in the 
embeddings field of your destination connector's table, collection, or index.

<Note>You can change a workflow's preconfigured provider only through [Custom](/ui/workflows#create-a-custom-workflow) workflow settings.</Note>
