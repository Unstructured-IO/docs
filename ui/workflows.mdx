## Workflows dashboard

![Workflows in the sidebar](/img/ui/Workflows-Sidebar.png)

To view the workflows dashboard, on the sidebar, click **Workflows**.

A workflow in Unstructured is a defined sequence of processes that automate the data handling from source to destination. It allows users to configure how and when data should be ingested, processed, and stored.

Workflows are crucial for establishing a systematic approach to managing data flows within the platform, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and adherence to specific data processing requirements.

## Create a workflow

Unstructured provides two types of workflow builders:

- [Automatic](#create-an-automatic-workflow) or **Build it For Me** workflows, which use sensible default workflow settings to enable you to get good-quality results faster.
- [Custom](#create-a-custom-worklow) or **Build it Myself** workflows, which enable you to fine-tune the workflow settings behind the scenes to get very specific results.

### Create an automatic workflow

<Warning>
    You must first have an existing source connector and destination connector to add to the workflow.

    If you do not have an existing connector for either your target source (input) or destination (output) location, [create the source connector](/ui/sources/overview), [create the destination connector](/ui/destinations/overview), and then return here.

    To see your existing connectors, on the sidebar, click **Connectors**, and then click **Sources** or **Destinations**.
</Warning>

To create an automatic workflow:

1. On the sidebar, click **Workflows**.
2. Click **New Workflow**.
3. Next to **Build it for Me**, click **Create Workflow**.

   <Note>If a radio button appears instead of **Build it for Me**, select it, and then click **Continue**.</Note>

4. For **Workflow Name**, enter some unique name for this workflow.
5. In the **Sources** dropdown list, select your source location.
6. In the **Destinations** dropdown list, select your destination location.

   <Note>You can select multiple source and destination locations. Files will be ingested from all of the selected source locations, and the processed data will be delivered to all of the selected destination locations.</Note>

7. Click **Continue**.
8. The **Reprocess All** box applies only to blob storage connectors such as the Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage connectors:

   - Checking this box reprocesses all documents in the source location on every workflow run.
   - Unchecking this box causes only new documents that are added to the source location since the last workflow run to be processed on future runs. Previously processed documents are not processed again, even if those documents' contents change.

9. Click **Continue**.
10. If you want this workflow to run on a schedule, in the **Repeat Run** dropdown list, select one of the scheduling options, and fill in the scheduling settings. Otherwise, select **Don't repeat**.
11. Click **Complete**.

By default, this workflow partitions, chunks, and generates embeddings as follows:

- **Partitioner**: **Auto** strategy

  Unstructured automatically analyzes and processes files on a page-by-page basis (for PDF files) and on a document-by-document basis for everything else:

  - If the page or document has no images and likely does not have tables, **Fast** partitioning is used, and the page or document is billed at the **Fast** rate for processing.
  - If the page or document has only a few tables or images with standard layouts and languages, **High Res** partitioning is used, and the page or document is billed at the **High Res** rate for processing.
  - If the page or document has more than a few tables or images, **VLM** partitioning is used, and the page or document is billed at the **VLM** rate for processing.

  [Learn about partitioning strategies](/ui/partitioning).

- **Chunker**: **Chunk by Title** strategy

  - **Contextual Chunking**: No (unchecked)
  - **Combine Text Under N Characters**: 3000
  - **Include Original Elements**: Yes (checked)
  - **Max Characters**: 5500
  - **Multipage Sections**: Yes (checked)
  - **New After N Characters**: 3500
  - **Overlap**: 350
  - **Overlap All**: Yes (checked)

  [Learn about chunking strategies](/ui/chunking).

- **Embedder**: 

  - **Provider**: Azure OpenAI
  - **Model**: text-embedding-3-large, with 3072 dimensions

  [Learn about embedding providers and models](/ui/embedding).

- **Enrichments**:

  This workflow contains no enrichments. 

  [Learn about available enrichments](/ui/enriching/overview).

After this workflow is created, you can change any or all of its settings if you want to. This includes the workflow's 
source connector, destination connector, partitioning, chunking, and embedding settings. You can also add enrichments 
to the workflow if you want to. 

To change the workflow's default settings or to add enrichments:

1. On the sidebar, click **Workflows**. 
2. In the list of available workflows, click the workflow that was just created. This opens a visual designer that shows 
   your workflow as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This DAG contains a node representing each step in the workflow. 
   There is one node for the partitioning step, another node for the chunking step, and so on.
3. To learn how to change a node's settings or to add enrichment nodes, click the **FAQ** button in the flyout pane in 
   the workflow DAG designer.

If you did not previously set the workflow to run on a schedule, you can [run the worklow](#edit-delete-or-run-a-workflow) now.

### Create a custom workflow

<Tip>
    If you already have an existing workflow that you want to change, do the following:
    
    1. On the sidebar, click **Workflows**.
    2. Click the name of the workflow that you want to change. 
    3. Skip ahead to Step 11 in the following procedure.

</Tip>

<Warning>
    You must first have an existing source connector and destination connector to add to the workflow.

    If you do not have an existing connector for either your target source (input) or destination (output) location, [create the source connector](/ui/sources/overview), [create the destination connector](/ui/destinations/overview), and then return here.

    To see your existing connectors, on the sidebar, click **Connectors**, and then click **Sources** or **Destinations**.
</Warning>

1. On the sidebar, click **Workflows**.
2. Click **New Workflow**.
3. Click the **Build it Myself** option, and then click **Continue**.
4. In the **This workflow** pane, click the **Details** button.

   ![Workflow details](/img/ui/Workflow-Details.png)

5. Next to **Name**, click the pencil icon, enter some unique name for this workflow, and then click the check mark icon.
6. If you want this workflow to run on a schedule, click the **Schedule** button. In the **Repeat Run** dropdown list, select one of the scheduling options, and fill in the scheduling settings.
7. To overwrite any previously processed files, or to retry any documents that fail to process, click the **Settings** button, and check either or both of the boxes.

   The **Reprocess All** box applies only to blob storage connectors such as the Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage connectors:

   - Checking this box reprocesses all documents in the source location on every workflow run.
   - Unchecking this box causes new documents that have been added to the source location, as well as existing documents in the source location that have had their contents or titles changed, since the last workflow run to be processed on future runs. Other previously processed documents are not processed again.

8. The workflow begins with the following layout:

    <Accordion title="Chunker node">
        For **Chunkers**, select one of the following:

        - **Chunk by title**: Preserve section boundaries and optionally page boundaries as well. A single chunk will never contain text that occurred in two different sections. When a new section starts, the existing chunk is closed and a new one is started, even if the next element would fit in the prior chunk. Also, specify the following:
        
          - **Contextual chunking**: When switched on, prepends chunk-specific explanatory context to each chunk. [Learn more](/ui/chunking#contextual-chunking).
          - **Combine text under n chars**: Combine elements until a section reaches a length of this many characters. The default is **0**.
          - **Include original elements**: Check this box to output the elements that were used to form a chunk, to appear in the `metadata` field's `orig_elements` field for that chunk. By default, this box is unchecked.
          - **Max characters**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. This is a strict limit. The default is **2048**.
          - **Multipage sections**: Check this box to allow sections to span multiple pages. By default, this box is unchecked.
          - **New after n chars**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. This is an approximate limit. The default is **1500*.
          - **Overlap**: Apply a prefix of this many trailing characters from the prior text-split chunk to second and later chunks formed from oversized elements by text-splitting. The default is **160**.
          - **Overlap all**: Check this box to apply overlap to "normal" chunks formed by combining whole elements. Use with caution as this can introduce noise into otherwise clean semantic units. By default, this box is unchecked.

        - **Chunk by character** (also known as _basic_ chunking): Combine sequential elements to maximally fill each chunk. Also, specify the following:

          - **Contextual chunking**: When switched on, prepends chunk-specific explanatory context to each chunk. [Learn more](/ui/chunking#contextual-chunking).
          - **Include original elements**: Check this box to output the elements that were used to form a chunk, to appear in the `metadata` field's `orig_elements` field for that chunk. By default, this box is unchecked.
          - **Max characters**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. The default is **2048**.
          - **New after n chars**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. This is an approximate limit. The default is **1500*.

          - **Overlap All**: Check this box to apply overlap to "normal" chunks formed by combining whole elements. Use with caution as this can introduce noise into otherwise clean semantic units. By default, this box is unchecked.
        
        - **Chunk by page**: Preserve page boundaries. When a new page is detected, the existing chunk is closed and a new one is started, even if the next element would fit in the prior chunk. Also, specify the following:
        
          - **Contextual chunking**: When switched on, prepends chunk-specific explanatory context to each chunk. [Learn more](/ui/chunking#contextual-chunking).
          - **Include original elements**: Check this box to output the elements that were used to form a chunk, to appear in the `metadata` field's `orig_elements` field for that chunk. By default, this box is unchecked.
          - **Max characters**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. This is a strict limit. The default is **500**.
          - **New after n chars**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. This is an approximate limit. The default is **50**.
          - **Overlap**: Apply a prefix of this many trailing characters from the prior text-split chunk to second and later chunks formed from oversized elements by text-splitting. The default is **30**.
          - **Overlap all**: Check this box to apply overlap to "normal" chunks formed by combining whole elements. Use with caution as this can introduce noise into otherwise clean semantic units. By default, this box is unchecked.
        
        - **Chunk by similarity**: Use the [sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1) embedding model to identify topically similar sequential elements and combine them into chunks. Also, specify the following:

          - **Contextual chunking**: When switched on, prepends chunk-specific explanatory context to each chunk. [Learn more](/ui/chunking#contextual-chunking).
          - **Include original elements**: Check this box to output the elements that were used to form a chunk, to appear in the `metadata` field's `orig_elements` field for that chunk. By default, this box is unchecked.
          - **Max characters**: Cut off new sections after reaching a length of this many characters. This is a strict limit. The default is **500**.
          - **Similarity threshold**: Specify a threshold between 0 and 1 exclusive (0.01 to 0.99 inclusive), where 0 indicates completely dissimilar vectors and 1 indicates identical vectors, taking into consider the trade-offs between precision (a higher threshold) and recall (a lower threshold). The default is **0.5**. [Learn more](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-embedding-clustering-and-similarity-11dd80b00061).

## Edit, delete, or run a workflow

To run a workflow once, manually:

1. On the sidebar, click **Workflows**.
2. In the list of workflows, click **Run** in the row for the workflow that you want to run.

For each of the workflows on the **Workflows** list page, the following actions are available by clicking the ellipses (the three dots) in the row for the respective workflow:

*   **Edit via Form**: Changes the existing configuration of your workflow.
*   **Delete**: Removes the workflow from the platform. Use this action cautiously, as it will permanently delete the workflow and its configurations.
*   **Open**: Opens the workflow's settings page.

## Pause a scheduled workflow

To stop running a workflow that is set to run on a repeating schedule:

1. On the sidebar, click **Workflows**.
2. In the list of workflows, turn off the **Status** toggle in the row for the workflow that you want to stop running on a repeated schedule.

Turning off the **Status** toggle also disables the workflow's **Run** button, which prevents that workflow from being run manually as well.

To resume running the workflow on its original repeating schedule, as well as enable the workflow to be run manually as needed, turn on the workflow's **Status** toggle.

## Duplicate a workflow

To duplicate (copy or clone) a workflow:

1. On the sidebar, click **Workflows**.
2. In the list of workflows, click the ellipses (the three dots) in the row for the workflow that you want to duplicate.
3. Click **Duplicate**.

   A duplicate of the workflow is created with the same configuration as the original workflow. The duplicate workflow has the same display name as the original 
   workflow but with **(Copy)** at the end.
