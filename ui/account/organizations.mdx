An _organization_ is a collection of Unstructured [workspaces](/account/workspaces). An Unstructured _organizational account_ manages 
Unstructured _account user access_ to workspaces within organizations.

Currently, only Unstructured representatives can create organizational accounts. To request an organizational account to be created, 
contact your Unstructured representative.

## Organizational account structure

An organizational account operates independently of all other organizational accounts. Each organization can have multiple [workspaces](/account/workspaces).

```mermaid
graph LR
    Org1[Organization 1]
    Org2[Organization 2]
    Org3[Organization 3]
    WS1A[Workspace 1A]
    WS2A[Workspace 2A]
    WS2B[Workspace 2B]
    WS3A[Workspace 3A]
    WS3B[Workspace 3B]
    WS3C[Workspace 3C]

    Org1 --> WS1A
    
    Org2 --> WS2A
    Org2 --> WS2B

    Org3 --> WS3A
    Org3 --> WS3B
    Org3 --> WS3C
```

An account user can have access to multiple organizational accounts.

```mermaid
graph LR
    User1[User 1]
    User2[User 2]
    User3[User 3]
    Org1[Organization 1]
    Org2[Organization 2]
    Org3[Organization 3]

    User1 -.-> Org1
    User2 -.-> Org1
    User2 -.-> Org2
    User3 -.-> Org1
    User3 -.-> Org2
    User3 -.-> Org3
```

Each user also has access to their own personal account, which is separate from any organizational accounts. Personal accounts do not have workspaces.

```mermaid
graph LR
    User1[User 1]
    User2[User 2]
    User3[User 3]
    PA1[Personal Account for User 1]
    PA2[Personal Account for User 2]
    PA3[Personal Account for User 3]
    Org1[Organization 1]
    Org2[Organization 2]
    Org3[Organization 3]

    User1 --> PA1
    User2 --> PA2
    User3 --> PA3
    User1 -.-> Org1
    User2 -.-> Org1
    User2 -.-> Org2
    User3 -.-> Org1
    User3 -.-> Org2
    User3 -.-> Org3
```

Within an organization, a user can have access to multiple workspaces within that organization.

```mermaid
graph LR
    User1[User 1]
    User2_Org1[User 2]
    User2_Org2[User 2]
    User3_Org1[User 3] 
    User3_Org2[User 3]
    User3_Org3[User 3]

    Org1[Organization 1]
    Org2[Organization 2]
    Org3[Organization 3]

    WS1A[Workspace 1A]
    WS2A[Workspace 2A]
    WS2B[Workspace 2B]
    WS3A[Workspace 3A]
    WS3B[Workspace 3B]
    WS3C[Workspace 3C]
    
    Org1 --> WS1A
    Org1 -.-> User1
    Org1 -.-> User2_Org1
    Org1 -.-> User3_Org1
    User1 -.-> WS1A
    User2_Org1 -.-> WS1A
    User3_Org1 -.-> WS1A
    
    Org2 --> WS2A
    Org2 --> WS2B
    Org2 -.-> User2_Org2
    Org2 -.-> User3_Org2
    User2_Org2 -.-> WS2A
    User2_Org2 -.-> WS2B
    User3_Org2 -.-> WS2B
    
    Org3 --> WS3A
    Org3 --> WS3B
    Org3 --> WS3C
    Org3 -.-> User3_Org3
    User3_Org3 -.-> WS3A
    User3_Org3 -.-> WS3B
    User3_Org3 -.-> WS3C
```

Each user must be explicitly added to the organizations&mdash;and workspaces within those organizations&mdash;that they are allowed to access.
