An API key is a unique string of characters used to authenticate calls to an application programming interface (API). 
In Unstructured, API keys are used as a kind of password that allows code or scripts to call the 
[Unstructured API](/api-reference/overview) to automate an Unstructured account on behalf of an associated account user 
or other entity tied to the API key that is provided with each call. This API key also enables Unstructured to associate 
usage and billing information with the related Unstructured account.

You need an API key whenever you want to call the Unstructured API's 
[Unstructured API's workflow operations](/api-reference/workflow/overview) or legacy 
[Unstructured Partition Endpoint](/api-reference/legacy-api/partition/overview).

You do not need an API key to use the [Unstructured user interface](/ui/overview) (UI) to create or manage connectors, workflows, 
or jobs in your Unstructured account, or to manage your Unstructured account.

<Note>
    For an Unstructured **Business** account, before you click **API Keys**, make sure you have selected the 
    [organizational workspace](/ui/account/workspaces) you want to access API keys and API URLs for.
</Note>

## View available API keys

1. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your Unstructured account.
2. On the sidebar, click **API Keys**.
3. Existing API keys are listed on the **API Keys** tab.

## Create a new API key

1. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your Unstructured account.
2. On the sidebar, click **API Keys**.
3. On the **API Keys** tab, click **Generate New Key**.
4. Enter some descriptive name for the API key, and then click **Save**.
5. The generated API key is displayed. Copy this API key to a secure location, as you will not be able to access it again after you close the dialog. If you lose this API key, you must generate a new one.

## Get an existing API key's value

After you create an API key and then close its creation confirmation dialog, you can no longer get that API key's value. 
You must [create a new API key](#create-a-new-api-key) instead.

If you are concerned that an unauthorized user or other entity might have this API key's value, you should [permanently delete](#permanently-delete-an-existing-api-key) this key.

## Enable or disable an existing API key

You might want to temporarily disable an existing API key that you suspect is causing some kind of issue or might be compromised in some way. 
However, you might want the option to re-enable it after you solve your issues or determine that it was not compromised.

1. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your Unstructured account.
2. On the sidebar, click **API Keys**.
3. On the **API Keys** tab, in the list of available keys, switch the **Status** toggle on or off for the target API key to enable or disable that key, respectively.

## Permanently delete an existing API key

<Warning>
    Deleting an existing API key is a permanent operation. Deleted API keys cannot be recovered.

    You cannot use a deleted API key to call the Unstructured APIs.
</Warning>

You might want to permanently delete an existing API key that you know is causing issues or is compromised.

If you have any code or scripts that rely on the old, existing API key that you want to permanently delete, you should rotate the key first. 
To rotate an old, existing API key before you permanently delete it:

1. Create a new, replacement API key by following the steps in [Create a new API key](#create-a-new-api-key), earlier on this page.
2. Update your code or scripts that rely on the old, existing API key's value that you want to permanently delete with the new, replacement API key's value.
3. Delete the old, existing API key.

To permanently delete an existing API key:

1. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your Unstructured account.
2. On the sidebar, click **API Keys**.
3. On the **API Keys** tab, in the list of available keys, click the **Options** vertical ellipsis for the target API key.
4. Click **Delete**.
5. Confirm that you want to permanently delete the API key by clicking **Continue**.
