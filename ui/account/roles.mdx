<Note>
    The following information applies only to Unstructured [organizational accounts](/ui/account/organizations), which are 
    available only for Unstructured **Team** and **Enterprise** accounts. To upgrade from an Unstructured **Starter** account 
    to a **Team** or **Enterprise** account, contact your Unstructured sales representative, or 
    email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).
</Note>

_Roles_ in Unstructured are part of the _role-based access control_ (RBAC) system that manages permissions for members of 
organizational accounts and their workspaces. (Roles are not used in personal accounts.)

Any member with the **Super Admin** role in an organizational account can manage the roles of that organizational account's members and the roles of the 
members of the organizational account's workspaces. 

Any member with the **Super Admin** role in an organizational account or the **Workspace Admin** role in a workspace within an 
organizational account can mange the roles of that workspace's members.

A **Super Admin** member assigns an organizational account member's initial role when they are [added to the organizational account](/ui/account/organizations#add-a-member-to-an-organizational-account). This member's 
initial role can be [changed](/ui/account/organizations#change-an-organizational-account-role-for-a-member) later.

A **Super Admin** or **Workspace Admin** member assigns a workspace member's initial role when they are [added to the workspace](/ui/account/workspaces#add-a-member-to-a-workspace). This 
member's initial role can be [changed](/ui/account/workspaces#change-a-workspace-role-for-a-member) later.
