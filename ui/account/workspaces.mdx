A _workspace_ is a collection of resources such as connectors, workflows, jobs, and API keys. 

Each workspace operates independently of all other workspaces.

## Workspace architecture

A workspace can belong to an [organizational account](/ui/account/organizations) or to a user's personal account. 

Every organizational account begins with one default workspace. An organizational account can have multiple workspaces. (A user's personal account always has one and only one workspace.)

```mermaid
graph LR
    Org1[Organization 1]
    Org2[Organization 2]
    Org3[Organization 3]
    WS1A[Workspace 1A]
    WS2A[Workspace 2A]
    WS2B[Workspace 2B]
    WS3A[Workspace 3A]
    WS3B[Workspace 3B]
    WS3C[Workspace 3C]

    Org1 --> WS1A
    
    Org2 --> WS2A
    Org2 --> WS2B

    Org3 --> WS3A
    Org3 --> WS3B
    Org3 --> WS3C
```

Users can have access to multiple workspaces within an organizational account.

    Org3 --> WS3A

    Org3 -.-> User3_Org3
    User3_Org3 -.-> WS3A
    User3_Org3 -.-> WS3B
    User3_Org3 -.-> WS3C
```

Each user must be explicitly added to each workspace that they are allowed to access. (A user always has access to their personal workspace within their personal account.) This assumes that the user has first been added 
to the workspace's parent organizational account.

To make programmatic API calls to a workspace instead of using the UI, an API key must first exist for that workspace. The caller then uses that API key to make API calls to that workspace. 
Each API key is valid only for its related workspace.

## Create a workspace

To create a workspace, you must first have an available Unstructured [organizational account](/account/organizations).

Currently, only Unstructured representatives can create organizational accounts. To request an organizational account to be created, 
contact your Unstructured 
sales representative, email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io), or complete the online 
[Unstructured contact form](https://unstructured.io/contact).

<Info>
    Your user must have the **Super Admin** [role](/ui/account/roles) in the intended workspace's parent organizational account to create workspaces in that organizational account.

    (A user always has one and only one personal workspace within their personal account. You cannot create additional workspaces in personal accounts.)
</Info>

1. Depending on the location of the organizational account that you want to access, sign in to [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io), 
   or sign in by using the URL for your organization's self-hosted deployment of Unstructured.
2. In the top navigation bar, in the organizational account selector, select the name of the organizational account that you want to add a workspace to.
3. In the sidebar, above your user icon, click the **Settings** (gear) icon.
4. Click **View All Workspaces**.
5. Click **New Workspace**.
6. In the **Create New Workspace** dialog, enter a name for the new workspace.
7. Optionally, enter a budget limit for the new workspace. If you do not want to set a budget limit, leave this field blank.

   <Warning>
       This workspace budget limit is for informational purposes only. Workspace usage is not stopped if this 
       limit is exceeded. 
   </Warning>
   
8. Click **Continue**.

## Access a workspace

1. Depending on the location of the organizational account that you want to access, sign in to [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io), 
   or sign in by using the URL for your organization's self-hosted deployment of Unstructured.
2. In the top navigation bar, in the organizational account selector, select the name of the organizational account that contains the workspace you want to access.
3. In the workspace selector, select the name of the workspace that you want to access.

   If the workspace selector does not show the workspace you want to access, then 
   your user has not been added to that workspace. To be added to the workspace, contact one of the workspace's administrators or its 
   parent organizational account's administrators.

## Add a member to a workspace

<Info>
    Your user must have either the **Super Admin** [role](/ui/account/roles) in the workspace's parent organizational account or the **Workspace Admin** role in the 
    workspace to add members to that workspace.

    The user to be added must also have the **Developer** role in the workspace's parent organizational account.

    (A user always has access to their personal workspace within their personal account.)
</Info>

To add a user to a workspace as a member:

1. Make sure the account user that you want to add has already been added as a member of the workspace's parent organizational account. 
   [Learn how](/ui/account/organizations#add-a-member-to-an-organization).

## Remove a member from a workspace

<Warning>
    A member who is removed from a workspace will no longer have access to the workspace. The member will continue to be able to use their personal account and personal workspace.
    
    Any connectors, workflows, jobs, or other resources that were created by the member within the workspace will not be removed.

    The only way to reverse removing a member from a workspace is to add the member back to the workspace.
</Warning>

<Info>
    Your user must have either the **Super Admin** [role](/ui/account/roles) in the workspace's parent organizational account or the **Workspace Admin** role in the 
    workspace to remove members from that workspace.

    (A user cannot be removed from their personal workspace within their personal account.)
</Info>

1. Depending on the location of the organizational account that you want to access, sign in to [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io), 
   or sign in by using the URL for your organization's self-hosted deployment of Unstructured.

## Create an API key for a workspace

    workspace to create API keys for that workspace.
</Info>

To make programmatic API calls to a workspace instead of using the UI, an API key must first exist for that workspace, and then the caller uses that API key to make API calls to that workspace.

An API key can be used only with the workspace for which it was created.

1. Depending on the location of the organizational account that you want to access, sign in to [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io), 
   or sign in by using the URL for your organization's self-hosted deployment of Unstructured.
2. In the top navigation bar, in the organizational account selector, select the name of the organizational account that contains the workspace you want to create an API key for.

   copies to your system's clipboard.

## Delete an API key for a workspace

An API key is valid only for the workspace for which it was created.

## Permanently delete a workspace

<Warning>
    Deleting a workspace is a permanent action and is not recoverable. Once a workspace is deleted, all connectors, workflows, jobs, and 
    API keys that are associated with that workspace are also deleted and are not recoverable.
    
    The workspace's members are not deleted, but they will no longer have access to the deleted workspace's connectors, workflows, jobs, and API keys.

    Any code or scripts that reference the deleted workspace's connectors, workflows, jobs, or workspace API keys will fail.
</Warning>

<Info>
    A user's personal workspace cannot be deleted from their personal account.
</Info>

Only authorized Unstructured representatives can delete workspaces. To request a workspace to be permanently deleted, contact your Unstructured 
sales representative, email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io), or complete the online 
[Unstructured contact form](https://unstructured.io/contact).
