A _workspace_ is a collection of resources within an Unstructured account. Workspaces are used to manage 
access to those resources by users within the related organization.

## Workspace structure

A workspace is part of one (and only one) [organization](/account/organizations) in an Unstructured account.

An organization can have multiple workspaces. An Unstructured account can have multiple organizations.

```mermaid
graph TD
    Account --> Org1[Organization 1]
    Account --> Org2[Organization 2]
    
    Org1 --> Workspace1A[Workspace 1A]
    Org1 --> Workspace1B[Workspace 1B]
    
    Org2 --> Workspace2A[Workspace 2A]
    Org2 --> Workspace2B[Workspace 2B]
```

Organization users can have access to multiple workspaces within the same organization.


```mermaid
graph TD
    OrgA[Organization A]
    
    OrgA -.-> User1[User 1]
    OrgA -.-> User2[User 2]
    OrgA -.-> User3[User 3]
    
    OrgA --> WorkspaceA1[Workspace A1]
    OrgA --> WorkspaceA2[Workspace A2]
    OrgA --> WorkspaceA3[Workspace A3]
    OrgA --> WorkspaceA4[Workspace A4]
    
    User1[User 1] -.-> WorkspaceA1
    User1[User 1] -.-> WorkspaceA2
    User2[User 2] -.-> WorkspaceA2
    User2[User 2] -.-> WorkspaceA3
    User3[User 3] -.-> WorkspaceA4
```

## Create a workspace

Currently, only Unstructured representatives can create organizations in Unstructured accounts. To request an organization to be created in your account, 
contact your Unstructured representative.
