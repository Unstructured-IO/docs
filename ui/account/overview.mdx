After you sign in to your Unstructured account, you can view your account's [usage](/ui/account/usage) details. 
If you are signing in to an Unstructured **Pay-As-You-Go** account, you can also manage your account's [billing](/ui/account/billing) details.

You can also create and manage your account's [API keys](/ui/account/api-key-url)&mdash;and get any [API URLs](/ui/account/api-key-url) as 
needed&mdash;to work programmatically with your Unstructured account through the [Unstructured API](/api-reference/overview).

An Unstructured [organizational account](/ui/account/organizations) is a special kind of account that can manage multiple 
[workspaces](/ui/account/workspaces) and use [roles](/ui/account/roles) to manage user access to the account and its workspaces. 
Unstructured organizational accounts apply only to Unstructured **Business** accounts.
