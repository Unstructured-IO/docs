title: Unstructured UI walkthrough
---

This page provides a walkthrough of the [Unstructured user interface (UI)](/ui/overview). As you follow along, you will get detailed, hands-on experience with 
Unstructured's [partitioning](/ui/partitioning), [enriching](/ui/enriching/overview), [chunking](/ui/chunking), and [embedding](/ui/embedding) features.

This walkthrough uses three sample files to demonstrate how Unstructured identifies and processes content such as image, graphs, complex tables, non-English characters, and English and non-English handwriting. 
These files, which are available for you to download to your local machine, include:

- Wang, Z., Liu, X., & Zhang, M. (2022, November 23). 
  _Breaking the Representation Bottleneck of Chinese Characters: Neural Machine Translation with Stroke Sequence Modeling_. 
  arXiv.org. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.12781. This 12-page PDF file features English and non-English characters, images, graphs, and complex tables. 
  Throughout this walkthrough, this file's title is shortened to "Chinese Characters" for brevity.
- Zohrevand, A., Sadri, J., & Imani, Z. (2025, September 3). _A comprehensive Persian offline handwritten database for investigating the effects of heritability and family relationships on handwriting_. 
  arXiv.org. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03510. This 36-page PDF file features English and non-English characters, non-English handwriting, images, graphs, and complex tables. 
  Throughout this walkthrough, this file's title is shortened to "Persian database" for brevity.
- United States Central Security Service. (2012, January 27). _National Cryptologic Museum Opens New Exhibit on Dr. John Nash_. 
  United States National Security Agency. https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/2012/files/H03-Cryptosystem-proposed-by-Nash.pdf. 
  This PDF file features English handwriting and scanned images of documents. 
  Throughout this walkthrough, this file's title is shortened to "Nash letters" for brevity.
