title: Summarizing
---

After partitioning, _summarizing_ generates text-based summaries of images and tables. 
This summarization is done by using models offered through various model providers.

Here is an example of the output of image summarization using GPT-4o. Note specifically the `text` field that is added. 
Line breaks have been inserted here for readability. The output will not contain these line breaks. 

```json
{
    "type": "Image",
    "element_id": "3303aa13098f5a26b9845bd18ee8c881",
    "text": "{\n  \"type\": \"graph\",\n  \"description\": \"The graph shows 
        the relationship between Potential (V) and Current Density (A/cm2). 
        The x-axis is labeled 'Current Density (A/cm2)' and ranges from 
        0.0000001 to 0.1. The y-axis is labeled 'Potential (V)' and ranges 
        from -2.5 to 1.5. There are six different data series represented 
        by different colors: blue (10g), red (4g), green (6g), purple (2g), 
        orange (Control), and light blue (8g). The data points for each series 
        show how the potential changes with varying current density.\"\n}",

Here is an example of the output of table summarization using GPT-4o. Note specifically the `text` field that is added.
Line breaks have been inserted here for readability. The output will not contain these line breaks.

```json
{
    "type": "Table",
    "element_id": "5713c0e90194ac7f0f2c60dd614bd24d",
    "text": "The table consists of 6 rows and 7 columns. The columns represent 
        inhibitor concentration (g), bc (V/dec), ba (V/dec), Ecorr (V), icorr 
        (A/cm\u00b2), polarization resistance (\u03a9), and corrosion rate 
        (mm/year). As the inhibitor concentration increases, the corrosion 
        rate generally decreases, indicating the effectiveness of the 
        inhibitor. Notably, the polarization resistance increases with higher 
        inhibitor concentrations, peaking at 6 grams before slightly 
        decreasing. This suggests that the inhibitor is most effective at 
        6 grams, significantly reducing the corrosion rate and increasing 
        polarization resistance. The data provides valuable insights into the 
        optimal concentration of the inhibitor for corrosion prevention.",

<Note>
    The `image_base64` field is generated only for documents or PDF pages that are [partitioned](/ui/partitioning) by using the High Res strategy. This field is not generated for 
    documents or PDF pages that are partitioned by using the Fast or VLM strategy.

## Summarize images or tables

import EnrichmentImagesTablesHiResOnly from '/snippets/general-shared-text/enrichment-images-tables-hi-res-only.mdx';

To summarize images or tables, in the **Task** drop-down list of an **Enrichment** node in a workflow, specify the following:

<Note>You can change a workflow's summarization settings only through [Custom](/ui/workflows#create-a-custom-workflow) workflow settings.</Note>

<EnrichmentImagesTablesHiResOnly />

For image summarization, select **Image Description**, and then choose one of the available provider (and model) combinations that are shown.

For table summarization, select **Table Description**, and then choose one of the available provider (and model) combinations that are shown.
