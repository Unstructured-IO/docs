title: Named entity recognition (NER)
---

After partitioning and chunking, you can have Unstructured generate a list of recognized entities and their types (such as the names of organizations, products, and people) in the content, through a process known as _named entity recognition_ (NER).

This NER is done by using models offered through these providers:

- [GPT-4o](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/), provided through OpenAI.
- [Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet), provided through Anthropic. 

Here is an example of a list of recognized entities and their types using GPT-4o. Note specifically the `entities` field that is added.

        as equally as may be into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall be vacated

# Generate a list of entities and their types

To generate a list of recognized entities and their types, in an **Enrichment** node in a workflow, specify the following:

<Note>
    You can change a workflow's NER settings only through [Custom](/ui/workflows#create-a-custom-workflow) workflow settings.
    
    Entities are only recognized when the **Partitioner** node in a workflow is also set to use the **High Res** partitioning strategy. [Learn more](/ui/partitioning).
</Note>

1. Select **Text**.
2. For **Model**, select either **OpenAI (GPT-4o)** or **Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)**.
3. The selected model will follow a default set of instructions (called a _prompt_) to perform NER using a set of predefined entity types. To experiment 
   with running the default prompt against some sample data, click **Edit**, and then click **Run Prompt**. The selected **Model** uses the 
   **Prompt** to run NER on the **Input sample** and shows the results in the **Output**. Look specifically at the `response_json` field for the 
   entities that were recognized and their types.
4. To customize the prompt, change the contents of **Prompt**.

   <Note>
       For best results, Unstructured strongly recommends that you limit your changes only to certain portions of the default prompt, specifically:

       - Adding, renaming, or deleting items in the list of predefined types (such as `PERSON`, `ORGANIZATION`, `LOCATION`, and so on).
       - As needed, adding any clarifying instructions only between these two lines:

         ```text
         ...
         Provide the entities and their corresponding types as a structured JSON response.

         (Add any clarifying instructions here only.)

         [START OF TEXT]
         ...
         ```

       - Changing any other portions of the default prompt could produce unexpected results.
   </Note>

5. To experiment with different data, change the contents of **Input sample**. For best results, Unstructured strongly recommends that the JSON structure in **Input sample** be preserved.
6. When you are satisfied with the **Model** and **Prompt** that you want to use, click **Save**.
