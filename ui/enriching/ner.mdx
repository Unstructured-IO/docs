title: Named entity recognition (NER)
---

After partitioning, you can have Unstructured generate a list of recognized entities and their types (such as the names of organizations, products, and people) in the content, through a process known as _named entity recognition_ (NER). 
You can also have Unstructured generate a list of relationships between the entities that are recognized.

This NER is done by using models offered through these providers:

- [GPT-4o](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/), provided through OpenAI.
- [Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet), provided through Anthropic. 

Here is an example of a list of recognized entities and their entity types, along with a list of relationships between those 
entities and their relationship types, using GPT-4o. Note specifically the `entities` field that is added to the `metadata` field.

Here is another example of some of the entities, their entity types, and relationships that are recognized for a given paragraph of text. This information 
is generated by GPT-4o by OpenAI:

![Named entity recognition for information in a paragraph of text](/img/enriching/NER-Example.png)

By default, the following entity types are supported for NER:

- `PERSON`
- `ORGANIZATION`
- `LOCATION`
- `DATE`
- `TIME`
- `EVENT`
- `MONEY`
- `PERCENT`
- `FACILITY`
- `PRODUCT`
- `ROLE`
- `DOCUMENT`
- `DATASET`

By default, the following entity relationships are supported for NER:

- `PERSON` - `ORGANIZATION`: `works_for`, `affiliated_with`, `founded`
- `PERSON` - `LOCATION`: `born_in`, `lives_in`, `traveled_to`
- `ORGANIZATION` - `LOCATION`: `based_in`, `has_office_in`
- Entity - `DATE`: `occurred_on`, `founded_on`, `died_on`, `published_in`
- `PERSON` - `PERSON`: `married_to`, `parent_of`, `colleague_of`
- `PRODUCT` - `ORGANIZATION`: `developed_by`, `owned_by`
- `EVENT` - `LOCATION`: `held_in`, `occurred_in`
- Entity - `ROLE`: `has_title`, `acts_as`, `has_role`
- `DATASET` - `PERSON`: `mentions`
- `DATASET` - `DOCUMENT`: `located_in`
- `PERSON` - `DATASET`: `published`
- `DOCUMENT` - `DOCUMENT`: `referenced_in`, `contains`
- `DOCUMENT` - `DATE`: `dated`
- `PERSON` - `DOCUMENT`: `published`

You can add, rename, or delete items in this list of default entity types and default entity relationship types. 
You can also add any clarifying instructions to the 
prompt that is used to run NER. To do this, see the next section. 

# Generate a list of entities and their relationships

To generate a list of recognized entities and their relationships, in an **Enrichment** node in a workflow, specify the following:

<Note>
    You can change a workflow's NER settings only through [Custom](/ui/workflows#create-a-custom-workflow) workflow settings.
</Note>

1. Select **Text**.
2. For **Model**, select either **OpenAI (GPT-4o)** or **Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)**.
3. The selected model will follow a default set of instructions (called a _prompt_) to perform NER using a set of predefined entity types and relationships. To experiment 
   with running the default prompt against some sample data, click **Edit**, and then click **Run Prompt**. The selected **Model** uses the 
   **Prompt** to run NER on the **Input sample** and shows the results in the **Output**. Look specifically at the `response_json` field for the 
   entities that were recognized and their relationships.
4. To customize the prompt, change the contents of **Prompt**.

   <Note>
       For best results, Unstructured strongly recommends that you limit your changes only to certain portions of the default prompt, specifically:

       - Adding, renaming, or deleting items in the list of predefined types (such as `PERSON`, `ORGANIZATION`, `LOCATION`, and so on).
       - Adding, renaming, or deleting items in the list of predefined relationships (such as `works_for`, `based_in`, `has_role`, and so on).
       - As needed, adding any clarifying instructions only between these two lines:

         ```text
         ...
         Provide the entities and their corresponding types as a structured JSON response.

         (Add any clarifying instructions here only.)

         [START OF TEXT]
         ...
         ```

       - Changing any other portions of the default prompt could produce unexpected results.
   </Note>

5. To experiment with different data, change the contents of **Input sample**. For best results, Unstructured strongly recommends that the JSON structure in **Input sample** be preserved.
6. When you are satisfied with the **Model** and **Prompt** that you want to use, click **Save**.
