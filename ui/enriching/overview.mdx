_Enriching_ adds enhancements to the processed data that Unstructured produces. These enrichments include:

- Providing a summarized description of the contents of a detected image. [Learn more](/ui/enriching/image-descriptions).
- Providing a summarized description of the contents of a detected table. [Learn more](/ui/enriching/table-descriptions).
- Providing a representation of a detected table in HTML markup format. [Learn more](/ui/enriching/table-to-html).
- Providing a list of recognized entities and their types, through a process known as _named entity recognition_ (NER). [Learn more](/ui/enriching/ner).
- Having a vision language model (VLM) use advanced optical character recognition (OCR) to improve the accuracy of initially-processed text blocks. [Learn more](/ui/enriching/generative-ocr).

To add an enrichment, in the workflow editor, click **+**, click **Enrich**, and then click one of the following enrichment node types:

<Note>
    You can change enrichment settings only through [Custom](/ui/workflows#create-a-custom-workflow) workflow settings.

- **Image Description** to provide a summarized description of the contents of each detected image. [Learn more](/ui/enriching/image-descriptions).
- **Table Description** to provide a summarized description of the contents of each detected table. [Learn more](/ui/enriching/table-descriptions).
- **Table to HTML** to provide a representation of each detected table in HTML markup format. [Learn more](/ui/enriching/table-to-html).
- **NER** to provide a list of recognized entities and their types by using a technique called _named entity recognition_ (NER). [Learn more](/ui/enriching/ner).
- **Generative OCR** to have a VLM use advanced OCR to improve the accuracy of initially-processed text blocks. [Learn more](/ui/enriching/generative-ocr).

To add multiple enrichments, create an additional enrichment node for each enrichment type that you want to add.
