_Enriching_ adds enhancments to the processed data that Unstructured produces. These enrichments include:

- Providing a summarized description of the contents of a detected image. [Learn more](/ui/enriching/image-descriptions).
- Providing a summarized description of the contents of a detected table. [Learn more](/ui/enriching/table-descriptions).
- Providing a representation of a detected table in HTML markup format. [Learn more](/ui/enriching/table-to-html).
- Providing a list of recognized entities and their types, through a process known as _named entity recognition_ (NER). [Learn more](/ui/enriching/ner).

To add an enrichment, in an **Enrichment** node in a workflow, select one of the following enrichment types:

<Note>
    You can change enrichment settings only through [Custom](/ui/workflows#create-a-custom-workflow) workflow settings.

    Enrichments work only when the **Partitioner** node in a workflow is also set to use the **High Res** partitioning strategy. [Learn more](/ui/partitioning).
</Note>

- **Image** to provide a summarized description of the contents of each detected image. [Learn more](/ui/enriching/image-descriptions).
- **Table** to provide a summarized description of the contents of each detected table. [Learn more](/ui/enriching/table-descriptions).
- **Table** can also provide a representation of each detected table in HTML markup format. [Learn more](/ui/enriching/table-to-html).
- **Text** to provide a list of recognized entities and their types by using a technique called _named entity recognition_ (NER). [Learn more](/ui/enriching/ner).

Currently, the **Text** enrichment type also supports custom prompts. In the **Details** tab, first select the input type **Text** and choose a provider (and model) combination. Then, under **Prompt**, click **Edit**.
You can test your custom prompt in the **Edit & Test Prompt** section by clicking **Run Prompt**.

To add multiple enrichments, create an additional **Enrichment** node for each enrichment type that you want to add.
