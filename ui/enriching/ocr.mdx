title: Text fidelity optimization
---

After partitioning, you can have a vision language model (VLM) optimize the fidelity of text blocks that Unstructured 
initially processed during its partitioning phase. 

Here are a few examples of Unstructured's output of text blocks that were initially processed, and the more accurate 
version of these text blocks that were optimized by using Claude Sonnet 4. Irrelevant lines of output have been omitted here for brevity. 

Before (vertical watermarked text, represented incorrectly):

```json
{
    "...", "...",
    "text": "3 2 0 2 t c O 9 2 ] V C . s c [ 2 v 9 0 8 6 1 . 0 1 3 2 : v i X r",
    "...", "..."
}
```

After (vertical watermarked text, now represented correctly from the original content):

```json
{
    "...", "...",
    "text": "arXiv:2310.16809v2 [cs.CV] 29 Oct 2023",
    "...", "..."
}
```

Before (hyperlink, represented incorrectly):

```json
{
    "...", "...",
    "text": "con/Yuliang-Liu/MultinodalOCR|",
    "...", "..."
}
```

After (hyperlink, now represented correctly from the original content):

```json
{
    "...", "...",
    "text": "https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/MultimodalOCR",
    "...", "..."
}
```

Before (Chinese characters, represented incorrectly):

```json
{
    "...", "...",
    "text": "GT SHE GPT4-V: EHES",
    "...", "..."
}
```

After (Chinese characters, now represented correctly from the original content, expressed as Unicode):

```json
{
    "...", "...",
    "text": "GT : \u91d1\u724c\u70e7\u814a GPT4-V: \u6587\u9759\u5019\u9e1f",
    "...", "..."
}
```

## Optimize text fidelity

import EnrichmentOCRHiResOnly from '/snippets/general-shared-text/enrichment-ocr-high-res-only.mdx';

To optimize text fidelity, in an **Enrichment** node in a workflow, select **OCR**, and then choose one of the available provider (and model) combinations that are shown.

<Note>
    You can change a workflow's image description settings only through [Custom](/ui/workflows#create-a-custom-workflow) workflow settings.

    For workflows that use [chunking](/ui/chunking), the **Chunker** node should be placed after all **Enrichment** nodes. Placing the 
    **Chunker** node before an image descriptions **Enrichment** node could cause incomplete or no image descriptions to be generated.
