title: Table descriptions
---

After partitioning, you can have Unstructured generate text-based summaries of detected tables.

This summarization is done by using models offered through various model providers.

Here is an example of the output of a detected table using GPT-4o. Note specifically the `text` field that is added.
Line breaks have been inserted here for readability. The output will not contain these line breaks.

```json
{
    "type": "Table",
    "element_id": "5713c0e90194ac7f0f2c60dd614bd24d",
    "text": "The table consists of 6 rows and 7 columns. The columns represent 
        inhibitor concentration (g), bc (V/dec), ba (V/dec), Ecorr (V), icorr 
        (A/cm\u00b2), polarization resistance (\u03a9), and corrosion rate 
        (mm/year). As the inhibitor concentration increases, the corrosion 
        rate generally decreases, indicating the effectiveness of the 
        inhibitor. Notably, the polarization resistance increases with higher 
        inhibitor concentrations, peaking at 6 grams before slightly 
        decreasing. This suggests that the inhibitor is most effective at 
        6 grams, significantly reducing the corrosion rate and increasing 
        polarization resistance. The data provides valuable insights into the 
        optimal concentration of the inhibitor for corrosion prevention.",
    "metadata": {
        "text_as_html": "<table>...<full results omitted for brevity>...</table>",
        "filetype": "application/pdf",
        "languages": [
            "eng"
        ],
        "page_number": 1,
        "image_base64": "/9j...<full results omitted for brevity>...//Z",
        "image_mime_type": "image/jpeg",
        "filename": "7f239e1d4ef3556cc867a4bd321bbc41.pdf",
        "data_source": {}
    }
}
```

<Note>
    The `image_base64` field is generated only for documents or PDF pages that are [partitioned](/ui/partitioning) by using the High Res strategy. This field is not generated for 
    documents or PDF pages that are partitioned by using the Fast or VLM strategy.
</Note>

Here are two examples of the descriptions for detected tables. These descriptions are generated with GPT-4o by OpenAI:

![Description of a table with information about endoscopic datasets](/img/enriching/Table-Description-1.png)

![Description of a table with information about potentiodynamic polarization of stainless steel](/img/enriching/Table-Description-2.png)

The generated table's summary will overwrite any text that Unstructured had previously extracted from that table into the `text` field. 
The table's original content is available in the `image_base64` field.

<Note>
    The `image_base64` field is generated only for documents or PDF pages that are [partitioned](/ui/partitioning) by using the High Res strategy. This field is not generated for 
    documents or PDF pages that are partitioned by using the Fast or VLM strategy.
</Note>

For workflows that use [chunking](/ui/chunking), note the following changes:

- If a `Table` element must be chunked, the `Table` element is replaced by a set of related `TableChunk` elements.
- Each of these `TableChunk` elements will contain a summary description only for its own element, as part of the element's `text` field.
- These `TableChunk` elements will not contain an `image_base64` field.

Any embeddings that are produced after these summaries are generated will be based on the new `text` field's contents.

## Generate table descriptions

import EnrichmentTableSummaryHiResOnly from '/snippets/general-shared-text/enrichment-table-summary-hi-res-only.mdx';

To generate table descriptions, in an **Enrichment** node in a workflow, select **Table**, and then choose one of the available provider (and model) combinations that are shown.

Make sure after you choose the provider and model, that **Table Description** is also displayed. If **Table Description** and **Table to HTML** are both 
displayed, be sure to select **Table Description**.

<Note>
    You can change a workflow's table description settings only through [Custom](/ui/workflows#create-a-custom-workflow) workflow settings.
    
    For workflows that use [chunking](/ui/chunking), the **Chunker** node should be placed after all **Enrichment** nodes. Placing the 
    **Chunker** node before a table descriptions **Enrichment** node could cause incomplete or no table descriptions to be generated.
