title: Partitioning
---

_Partitioning_ extracts content from raw unstructured files and outputs that content as structured [document elements](/ui/document-elements).

For specific file types, such as image files and PDF files, Unstructured offers special strategies to partition them. Each of these 
strategies has trade-offs for output speed, cost to output, and quality of output.

PDF files, for example, vary in quality and complexity. In simple cases, traditional natural language processing (NLP) extraction techniques might 
be enough to extract all the text out of a document. In other cases, advanced image-to-text models are required 
to process a PDF file. Some of these strategies implement rule-based workflows, which can be faster and cheaper, because they always 
extract in the same way, but you might sometimes get lower-quality resolution. Other strategies implement 
model-based workflows, which can be slower and costlier because they require a model that performs inference, but you can get higher-quality resolution. 
When you choose a partitioning strategy for your files, you should be mindful of these speed, cost, and quality trade-offs. 
For example, the **Fast** strategy can be about 100 times faster than leading image-to-text models.

To choose one of these strategies, select one of the following four **Partition Strategy** options in the **Partitioner** node of a workflow.

<Note>You can change a workflow's preconfigured strategy only through [Custom](/ui/workflows#create-a-custom-workflow) workflow settings.</Note>
