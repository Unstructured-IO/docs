## Local file quickstart

The following quickstart shows you how to use the Unstructured UI to process a single file that is stored on your local machine. 
This approach is ideal for rapid testing and prototyping of Unstructured ETL+ workflows, across the full range of Unstructured features, 
against a single representative file. 

To process files (or data) in remote locations instead, skip ahead to the [remote quickstart](#remote-quickstart).

import GetStartedSimpleUIOnly from '/snippets/general-shared-text/get-started-simple-ui-only.mdx';

<GetStartedSimpleUIOnly />

3. After you sign in, watch the following 2-minute video:

  title="YouTube video player"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

4. To move beyond local file processing, you can try the following [remote quickstart](#remote-quickstart), or skip over to the [Dropbox source connector quickstart](/ui/sources/dropbox-source-quickstart) instead.

   You can also learn about Unstructured [source connectors](/ui/sources/overview), [destination connectors](/ui/destinations/overview), [workflows](/ui/workflows), [jobs](/ui/jobs), and [managing your account](/ui/account/overview).
