This page contains two quickstarts to help you get started with the Unstructured user interface (UI).

- The [local quickstart](#local-quickstart) is an ideal starting point and requires no prior setup. It shows you how to use the Unstructured UI to process a single file that is stored on your local machine. 
  This approach is ideal for rapid testing and prototyping of Unstructured ETL+ workflows, across the full range of Unstructured features, against a single representative file.
- The [remote quickstart](#remote-quickstart) takes a bit longer, but it shows you how to use the UI to set up and run Unstructured ETL+ workflows against files and data stored in 
  remote source file and object stores, websites, databases, and vector stores. Unstructured delivers the resulting processed data to remote destination file and object stores, databases, and vector stores. 
  This approach is ideal for production use cases, where you want to process large volumes of files and data in a scalable and efficient manner.

<Tip>
    If you're not sure which quickstart to use, we recommend starting with the [local quickstart](#local-quickstart). 
    
    The local quickstart is a fast and easy way to learn about 
    Unstructured. When you're happy with the results from the workflow that you create there, it is straightforward to turn it into a production-ready workflow with 
    all of the settings that you want already in place!
