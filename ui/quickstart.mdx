## Local file quickstart

The following quickstart shows you how to use the Unstructured UI to process a single file that is stored on your local machine. 
This approach is ideal for rapid testing and prototyping of Unstructured ETL+ workflows, across the full range of Unstructured features, 
against a single representative file. 

To process files (or data) in remote locations, skip ahead to the [remote quickstart](#remote-quickstart).

1. Sign up for a single-user Unstructured **Starter** account at [https://unstructured.io/developers](https://unstructured.io/developers).

   <Note>
       For **Team** and **Enterprise** accounts, contact 
       Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).
   </Note>

2. Sign in to your new Unstructured **Starter** or **Team** account at [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io).

   <Note>
       For **Enterprise** accounts, see your 
       Unstructured account administrator or Unstructured Sales representative.
   </Note>

3. After you sign in, watch the following 2-minute video:
