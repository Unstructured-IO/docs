title: Dropbox source connector quickstart
---

Unstructured can connect to several types of [sources](/ui/connectors). In this quickstart, you create a Dropbox source connector that you can add to your Unstructured [workflows](/ui/workflows). 
This source connector enables your Unstructured workflowsto process your files that you store in a Dropbox account.

In this quickstart, you will:

- Create a free Dropbox Basic account.
- Create a Dropbox app in your Dropbox account. This app will provide the connection between your Dropbox account and your Unstructured account.
- Get specific information about your Dropbox app that Unstructured needs to connect to the app.
- Create a Dropbox source connector in your Unstructured account.
- Add the Dropbox source connector to a workflow in your Unstructured account.

If you are not able to complete the following steps, contact Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).

## Step 1: Create your Dropbox account

In this step, you create a [free Dropbox Basic account](https://www.dropbox.com/basic). This account is limited to a single user and 2 GB of storage.

If you already have a Dropbox account and want to use it instead, then skip ahead to Step 2.

1. Go to the Dropbox account sign up page, at [https://www.dropbox.com/register](https://www.dropbox.com/register).
2. Enter your email address, and then click **Continue**.
3. Enter your name and then, for **Password**, enter some password for your new account. Be sure to save this password to some secure location, 
   as you will need it to access your Dropbox account later.
4. Click **Agree and sign up**.
5. To create a Dropbox Basic account, click the **Personal** tile.
6. When you are prompted to install the Dropbox desktop app or mobile app, click **Skip step**. (You can always install these apps later.)
7. To create a Dropbox Basic account, click **Continue with 2 GB Dropbox Basic plan** at the bottom of the account type selectionpage.
8. You are automatically signed in to your new Dropbox Basic account, and the Dropbox user interface (UI) appears.

## Step 2: Create a Dropbox app

In this step, you create a Dropbox app in your Dropbox account. Unstructured will use this app to access your Dropbox account.

1. From a new tab in your web browser, open the Dropbox Developers page, at [https://www.dropbox.com/developers](https://www.dropbox.com/developers).
2. Click **Create apps**.

   ![Begin creating a Dropbox app](/img/dropbox-quickstart/Create-Apps.png)

   <Tip>
       If **Create apps** is not visible then, on the top navigation bar, click **App Console**, and then click **Create app**.
   </Tip>

3. For **Choose an API**, select the **Scoped access** radio button.
4. For **Choose the type of access you need**, select the **App folder** radio button.
5. For **Name your app**, enter some name for your Dropbox app.
6. Check the box labelled **I agree to Dropbox API Terms and Conditions**, if it appears.
7. Click **Create app**.

   ![Finish creating the Dropbox app](/img/dropbox-quickstart/Create-App.png)

8. On the Dropbox app's **Permissions** tab, under **Files and folders**, check the box labelled **files.content.read**, and then click **Submit**.

   ![Setting files.content.read for the Dropbox app](/img/dropbox-quickstart/Files-Content-Read.png)

9. On the app's **Settings** tab, note the value of the **App folder name** field. This is the name of the subfolder that Dropbox will create under the `Apps` top-level folder in your Dropbox account. Your new Dropbox app will use this subfolder for access. 

   ![Noting the app folder's name](/img/dropbox-quickstart/App-Folder-Name.png)

10. With the app's **Settings** tab still showing, scroll down to **App key**.
11. Next to **App secret**, click **Show**.
12. Note the values of **App key** and **App secret**, as you will need them later for Steps 3 and 5.

    ![Noting the app's key and secret](/img/dropbox-quickstart/App-Key-App-Secret.png)

## Step 3: Get a refresh token for your Dropbox app

In this step, you get a refresh token for your Dropbox app. Unstructured needs this refresh token, along with the 
**App key** and **App secret** from the previous step, to be able to use your Dropbox app to connect to your Dropbox account. 

1. In a new tab in your web browser, enter the following address. In this address, 
   replace `<app-key>` with the **App key** you noted in Step 2:
   
   ```bash
   https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<app-key>&response_type=code&token_access_type=offline
   ```

   For example, if your **App key** is `aaa1aaaaaa1aaaa`, then your address should look like this:

   ```bash
   https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=aaa1aaaaaa1aaaa&response_type=code&token_access_type=offline
   ```

2. Click **Continue**.

   ![Continuing to get the access code](/img/dropbox-quickstart/Access-Code-Continue.png)

3. Click **Allow**.

   ![Allowing the access code to be generated](/img/dropbox-quickstart/Access-Code-Allow.png)

4. Note the value in the **Access Code Generated** box. 

   ![Viewing the generated access code](/img/dropbox-quickstart/Access-Code-Generated.png)

   <Tip>
       This same access code value also appears in the **auth_code** parameter from the address bar. For example, if the address bar shows this:

       ```bash
       https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize_success?auth_code=ccc1ccc1ccc1-1cc-1cc&client_id=aaa1aaaaaa1aaaa&version=1
       ```

       Then the **auth_code** value is `ccc1ccc1ccc1-1cc-1cc`.
   </Tip>

5. On your computer, open the Terminal if you're using macOS, a terminal window if you're using Linux, or the Command Prompt if you're using Windows.
6. Check to see if the `curl` utility is alredy installed on your computer by running the following command:

   ```bash
   curl --version
   ```

7. If the `curl` utility is already installed, then you will see the `curl` version number and some other information about `curl`.

   If some kind of error message appears instead, then install `curl` on your computer by following [instructions for your operating system](https://ec.haxx.se/install/index.html).

8. From your Terminal, terminal window, or Command Prompt, run the following `curl` command. In this command, 
   replace the following placeholders:
   
   - Replace `<app-key>` with the **App key** you noted in Step 2.
   - Replace `<app-secret>` with the **App secret** you noted in Step 2.
   - Replace `<access-code>` with the **Access Code Generated** (or `auth_code`, if you followed the Tip) that you noted earlier in this step.

   <Icon icon="apple" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<Icon icon="linux" />&nbsp;&nbsp;For macOS or Linux, run this `curl` command:

   ```bash
   curl --location --request POST 'https://api.dropbox.com/oauth2/token' \
   --user '<app-key>:<app-secret>' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
   --data-urlencode 'code=<access-code>' \
   --data-urlencode 'grant_type=authorization_code'
   ```

   <Icon icon="apple" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<Icon icon="linux" />&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if your **App key** is `aaa1aaaaaa1aaaa`, your **App secret** is `bbb1bbb1bbb1bbb1`, and your **Access Code Generated** or `auth_code` value is `ccc1ccc1ccc1-1cc-1cc`, then your command should look like this:

   ```bash
   curl --location --request POST 'https://api.dropbox.com/oauth2/token' \
   --user 'aaa1aaaaaa1aaaa:bbb1bbb1bbb1bbb1' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
   --data-urlencode 'code=ccc1ccc1ccc1-1cc-1cc' \
   --data-urlencode 'grant_type=authorization_code'
   ```

   <Icon icon="windows" />&nbsp;&nbsp;For Windows, run this `curl` command:
   
   ```bash
   curl --location --request POST "https://api.dropbox.com/oauth2/token" ^
   --user "<app-key>:<app-secret>" ^
   --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" ^
   --data-urlencode "code=<access-code>" ^
   --data-urlencode "grant_type=authorization_code"
   ```

   <Icon icon="windows" />&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if your **App key** is `aaa1aaaaaa1aaaa`, your **App secret** is `bbb1bbb1bbb1bbb1`, and your **Access Code Generated** or `auth_code` value is `ccc1ccc1ccc1-1cc-1cc`, then your command should look like this:

   ```bash
   curl --location --request POST "https://api.dropbox.com/oauth2/token" ^
   --user "aaa1aaaaaa1aaaa:bbb1bbb1bbb1bbb1" ^
   --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" ^
   --data-urlencode "code=ccc1ccc1ccc1-1cc-1cc" ^
   --data-urlencode "grant_type=authorization_code"
   ```

9. In the response, note the vaue of the `refresh_token` field, which you will need later for Step 5. For example, if the response looks like this 
    (line breaks are added here for readability&mdash;the actual response will not have these line breaks):

   ```bash
   {
       "access_token": "sl.u.AF-aaa1aaa1", 
       "token_type": "bearer", 
       "expires_in": 14400, 
       "refresh_token": "ddd1ddd1ddd1ddd1", <-- Note this value.
       "scope": "account_info.read files.content.read files.metadata.read", 
       "uid": "1111111111", 
       "account_id": "dbid:aaa1aaa1aaa1"
   }
   ```

   Then the value of the `refresh_token` field is `ddd1ddd1ddd1ddd1`.

## Step 4: Upload documents to your Dropbox app folder

In this step, you add your documents to your Dropbox app folder in your Dropbox account.

1. In the Dropbox UI from Step 1, expand `Apps`, and then click the folder that matches the **App folder name** field you noted in Step 2.

   ![Selecting the app folder](/img/dropbox-quickstart/Select-App-Folder.png)

   <Tip>
       If the `Apps` folder is not clickable, or if Dropbox reports that the folder is not found, 
       then try refreshing the page and clicking the `Apps` folder again.
   </Tip>

2. Click **Create folder**.

   ![Begin creating the subfolder](/img/dropbox-quickstart/Create-Folder.png)

3. Give the subfolder a name, and then click **Create**.

   ![Finish creating the subfolder](/img/dropbox-quickstart/Create-Apps-Subfolder.png)

4. Click **Upload or drop** (or **Upload > Files** or **Upload > Folder**), and then follow the on-screen instructions to upload some documents to this subfolder in your Dropbox app folder. 
   For a Dropbox Basic account, the total size of all of the files you upload and store in your Dropbox account (not just this subfolder) cannot exceed 2 GB.

   ![Upload files to subfolder](/img/dropbox-quickstart/Upload-To-Apps-Subfolder.png)

## Step 5: Create the Dropbox source connector

In this step, you create a Dropbox source connector in your Unstructured account. This source connector 
is used by Unstructured to connect to your Dropbox account and then process the documents in the specified folder.

1. If you do not already have an Unstructured account, [sign up for free](https://unstructured.io/?modal=try-for-free). 
   After you sign up, you are automatically signed in to your new Unstructured **Starter** account, at [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io).

   <Note>
       To sign up for a **Team** or **Enterprise** account instead, [contact Unstructured Sales](https://unstructured.io/?modal=contact-sales), or [learn more](/ui/overview#how-am-i-billed%3F).
   </Note>

2. If you have an Unstructured **Starter** or **Team** account and are not already signed in, sign in to your account at [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io).

   <Note>
       For an **Enterprise** account, see your Unstructured account administrator for instructions, 
       or email Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).
   </Note>

3. On the sidebar, click **Connectors**.

   ![Connectors sidebar icon](/img/dropbox-quickstart/Sidebar-Connectors.png)

4. Click **+ New**.
5. Enter some unique name for this connector, for example `dropbox-source-connector`.
6. For **Type**, click **Source**.
7. For **Provider**, click **Dropbox**.
8. Click **Continue**.

   ![Selecting the connector type](/img/dropbox-quickstart/Select-Connector-Type.png)

9. For **Data URL**, enter `dropbox://`, followed by the name of the subfolder you created in the previous step. For example, 
   if the name of the subfolder is `my-folder`, then the data URL would be `dropbox://my-folder`.

   ![Forming the data URL](/img/dropbox-quickstart/Apps-Subfolder-Name.png)

10. For **App key**, enter the **App key** you noted in Step 2.
11. For **App secret**, enter the **App secret** you noted in Step 2.
12. For **Refresh token**, enter the **Refresh token** you noted in Step 3.
13. Click **Save and Test**, and wait while Unstructured tests the connector.

   ![Entering connector settings](/img/dropbox-quickstart/Source-Connector-Settings.png)

14. If a green **Successful** message appears, then you have successfully created the connector. 

    ![Successful connector test](/img/dropbox-quickstart/Connector-Test-Success.png)

    If, however, a red error message appears, fix the issue, and try this step again.

    If you cannot fix the issue, contact Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).

Congratulations! You have successfully created a Dropbox source connector in your Unstructured account.
