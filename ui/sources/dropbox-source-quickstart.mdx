title: Dropbox source connector quickstart
---

Unstructured can connect to several types of [sources](/ui/connectors). In this quickstart, you create a Dropbox source connector that you can add to your Unstructured [workflows](/ui/workflows). 
This source connector enables your Unstructured workflowsto process your files that you store in a Dropbox account.

In this quickstart, you will:

- Create a free Dropbox Basic account.
- Create a Dropbox app in your Dropbox account.
- Get specific information about your Dropbox app that Unstructured needs to connect to your Dropbox account.
- Create a Dropbox source connector in your Unstructured account.
- Add the Dropbox source connector to a workflow in your Unstructured account.

If you are not able to complete the following steps, contact Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).

## Step 1: Create your Dropbox account

In this step, you create a free Dropbox Basic account. This account is limited to a single user and 2 GB of storage.

If you already have a Dropbox account and want to use it instead, then skip ahead to Step 2.

1. Go to the Dropbox account sign up page, at [https://www.dropbox.com/register](https://www.dropbox.com/register).
2. Enter your email address, and then click **Continue**.
3. Enter your name and then, for **Password**, enter some password for your new account. Be sure to save this password to some secure location, 
   as you will need it to access your Dropbox account later.
4. Click **Agree and sign up**.
5. Click the **Personal** tile.
6. Optionally, you can install the Dropbox desktop app or mobile app by folowing the on-screen instructions. 
   Otherwise, click **Skip step**.
7. Click **Continue with 2 GB Dropbox Basic plan**.
8. You are automatically signed in to your new Dropbox Basic account, and the Dropbox user interface (UI) appears.

## Step 2: Create a Dropbox app

In this step, you create a Dropbox app in your Dropbox account. Unstructured will use this app to access your Dropbox account.

1. From a new tab in your web browser, open the Dropbox Developers page, at [https://www.dropbox.com/developers](https://www.dropbox.com/developers).
2. Click **Create apps**.
3. If prompted by Dropbox, click **Send email for verification**, and complete the on-screen instructions to verify your email address with Dropbox.

   a. In your email inbox, look for an email from Dropbox. Open the email and click the **Verify your mail** button.<br/>
   b. Enter your email address, and then click **Continue**.<br/>
   c. Enter your Dropbox account password, and then click **Log in**.<br/>

4. For **Choose an API**, select the **Scoped access** radio button.
5. For **Choose the type of access you need**, select the **App folder** radio button.
6. For **Name your app**, enter some name for your Dropbox app.
7. Check the box labelled **I agree to Dropbox API Terms and Conditions**.
8. Click **Create app**.

   .. Create-App.png

9. On the Dropbox app's **Permissions** tab, under **Files and folders**, check the box labelled **files.content.read**, and then click **Submit**.

   .. Files-Content-Read.png

10. On the app's **Settings** tab, note the value of the **App folder name** field. This is the name of the subfolder that Dropbox will create under the `Apps` top-level folder in your Dropbox account. Your new Dropbox app will use this subfolder for access. 

    .. App-Folder-Name.png

11. With the app's **Settings** tab still showing, scroll down to **App key**.
12. Next to **App secret**, click **Show**.
13. Note the values of **App key** and **App secret**, as you will need them for the next step.

    .. App-Key-App-Secret.png

## Step 3: Get information about the Dropbox app

In this step, you get information that Unstructured needs about your Dropbox app. Unstructured needs this information 
to be able to connect to your Dropbox account.

1. In a new tab in your web browser, enter the following address. In this address, 
   replace `<app-key>` with the **App key** you noted in Step 2:
   
   ```bash
   https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<app-key>&response_type=code&token_access_type=offline
   ```

   For example, if your **App key** is `aaa1aaaaaa1aaaa`, then your address should look like this:

   ```bash
   https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=aaa1aaaaaa1aaaa&response_type=code&token_access_type=offline
   ```

2. Click **Continue**.

   .. Access-Code-Continue.png

3. Click **Allow**.

   .. Access-Code-Allow.png

4. Note the value in the **Access Code Generated** box. 

   .. Access-Code-Generated.png

   This same value also appears in the **auth_code** parameter from the address bar. For example, if the address bar shows this:

   ```bash
   https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize_success?auth_code=ccc1ccc1ccc1-1cc-1cc&client_id=aaa1aaaaaa1aaaa&version=1
   ```

   Then the **auth_code** value is `ccc1ccc1ccc1-1cc-1cc`.

5. On your computer, open the Terminal if you're using macOS, a terminal window if you're using Linux, or the Command Prompt if you're using Windows.
6. Check to see if the `curl` utility is alredy installed on your computer by running the following command:

   ```bash
   curl --version
   ```

7. If the `curl` utility is already installed, then you will see the `curl` version number and some other information about `curl`.
8. If some kind of error message appears, then install `curl` on your computer by following the instructions for your operating system.
9. From your Terminal, terminal window, or Command Prompt, run the following `curl` command. In this command, 
   replace the following placeholders:
   
   - Replace `<app-key>` with the **App key** you noted in Step 2.
   - Replace `<app-secret>` with the **App secret** you noted in Step 2.
   - Replace `<access-code>` with the **Access Code Generated** or `auth_code` value you noted earlier in this step.

   For macOS or Linux, run this `curl` command:

   ```bash
   curl --location --request POST 'https://api.dropbox.com/oauth2/token' \
   --user '<app-key>:<app-secret>' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
   --data-urlencode 'code=<access-code>' \
   --data-urlencode 'grant_type=authorization_code'
   ```

   For example, if your **App key** is `aaa1aaaaaa1aaaa`, your **App secret** is `bbb1bbb1bbb1bbb1`, and your **Access Code Generated** or `auth_code` value is `ccc1ccc1ccc1-1cc-1cc`, then your command should look like this:

   ```bash
   curl --location --request POST 'https://api.dropbox.com/oauth2/token' \
   --user 'aaa1aaaaaa1aaaa:bbb1bbb1bbb1bbb1' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
   --data-urlencode 'code=ccc1ccc1ccc1-1cc-1cc' \
   --data-urlencode 'grant_type=authorization_code'
   ```

   For Windows, run this `curl` command:
   
   ```bash
   curl --location --request POST "https://api.dropbox.com/oauth2/token" ^
   --user "<app-key>:<app-secret>" ^
   --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" ^
   --data-urlencode "code=<access-code>" ^
   --data-urlencode "grant_type=authorization_code"
   ```

   For example, if your **App key** is `aaa1aaaaaa1aaaa`, your **App secret** is `bbb1bbb1bbb1bbb1`, and your **Access Code Generated** or `auth_code` value is `ccc1ccc1ccc1-1cc-1cc`, then your command should look like this:

   ```bash
   curl --location --request POST "https://api.dropbox.com/oauth2/token" ^
   --user "aaa1aaaaaa1aaaa:bbb1bbb1bbb1bbb1" ^
   --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" ^
   --data-urlencode "code=ccc1ccc1ccc1-1cc-1cc" ^
   --data-urlencode "grant_type=authorization_code"
   ```

10. In the response, note the vaue of the `refresh_token` field. For example, if the response looks like this 
    (line breaks are added here for readability&dash;the actual response will not have these line breaks):

    ```bash
    {
        "access_token": "sl.u.AF-aaa1aaa1", 
        "token_type": "bearer", 
        "expires_in": 14400, 
        "refresh_token": "ddd1ddd1ddd1ddd1", <-- Note this value.
        "scope": "account_info.read files.content.read files.metadata.read", 
        "uid": "1111111111", 
        "account_id": "dbid:aaa1aaa1aaa1"
    }
    ```

    Then the value of the `refresh_token` field is `ddd1ddd1ddd1ddd1`.

## Step 4: Upload documents to your Dropbox app folder

In this step, you add your documents to your Dropbox app folder in your Dropbox account.

1. In the Dropbox UI from Step 1, expand `Apps`, and then click the folder that matches the **App folder name** field you noted in Step 2.

   <Note>
       If the `Apps` folder is not clickable, or if Dropbox reports that the folder is not found, 
       then try refreshing the page and clicking the `Apps` folder again.
   </Note>

2. Click **Create folder**.
3. Give the subfolder a name, and then click **Create**.

   .. Create-Apps-Subfolder.png

4. Click **Upload**, and then follow the on-screen instructions to upload some documents to this subfolder in your Dropbox app folder. 
   For a Dropbox Basic account, the total size of all of the files you upload and store in your Dropbox account (not just this subfolder) cannot exceed 2 GB.

   .. Upload-To-Apps-Subfolder.png

## Step 5: Create the Dropbox source connector

In this step, you create a Dropbox source connector in your Unstructured account. This source connector 
is used by Unstructured to connect to your Dropbox account and then process the documents in the specified folder.

1. If you do not already have an Unstructured account, [sign up for free](https://unstructured.io/?modal=try-for-free). 
   After you sign up, you are automatically signed in to your new Unstructured **Starter** account, at [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io).

   <Note>
       To sign up for a **Team** or **Enterprise** account instead, [contact Unstructured Sales](https://unstructured.io/?modal=contact-sales), or [learn more](/ui/overview#how-am-i-billed%3F).
   </Note>

2. If you have an Unstructured **Starter** or **Team** account and are not already signed in, sign in to your account at [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io).

   <Note>
       For an **Enterprise** account, see your Unstructured account administrator for instructions, 
       or email Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).
   </Note>

3. On the sidebar, click **Connectors**.

   .. Sidebar-Connectors.png

4. Click **+ New**.
5. Enter some unique name for this connector, for example `dropbox-source-connector`.
6. For **Type**, click **Source**.
7. For **Provider**, click **Dropbox**.
8. Click **Continue**.

   .. Select-Connector-Type.png

9. For **Data URL**, enter `dropbox://`, followed by the name of the subfolder you created in the previous step. For example, 
   if the name of the subfolder is `my-folder`, then the data URL would be `dropbox://my-folder`.

   .. Apps-Subfolder-Name.png

10. For **App key**, enter the **App key** you noted in Step 2.
11. For **App secret**, enter the **App secret** you noted in Step 2.
12. For **Refresh token**, enter the **Refresh token** you noted in Step 3.
13. Click **Save and Test**, and wait while Unstructured tests the connector.

   .. Source-Connector-Settings.png

14. If a green **Successful** message appears, then you have successfully created the connector.
