<Note>
    To proceed with a self-hosted deployment, your organization must first sign a self-hosting agreement with Unstructured.

    If you have not yet signed this agreement, stop here, and begin the self-hosting agreement process by emailing 
    Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io), or fill out the [contact form](https://unstructured.io/contact) 
    on the Unstructured website.
</Note>

After your organization has signed the self-hosting agreement with Unstructured, a member of the Unstructured technical enablement team will reach out to you to begin the 
deployment onboarding process. To streamline this process, you are encouraged to begin setting up your target environment as soon as possible. To do this, you 
must first set up your hardware as follows.

## Questions? Need help?

If you have questions or need help as you go, contact your Unstructured sales representative or technical enablement contact. If you do not know who they are, 
email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io), or fill out the 
[contact form](https://unstructured.io/contact) on the Unstructured website, and a member of the Unstructured sales or technical enablement teams 
will get back to you as soon as possible.
