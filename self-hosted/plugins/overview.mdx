In Unstructured, a _plugin_ is a self-contained unit of code that can be used to add, change, or use data within the context of an Unstructured ETL+ workflow. Every 
node in a workflow is itself a plugin. You can also create your own plugins to extend your organization's workflow capabilities. 

Developing, deploying, and running your own custom plugins is available only for  
the [Unstructured user interface](/ui/overview) (UI) that has already been deployed to 
infrastructure that you maintain in your 
[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](/self-hosted/aws/overview), [Azure](/self-hosted/azure/overview), or
[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](/self-hosted/gcp/overview) account.

If you do not already have a self-hosted deployment of the Unstructured UI, 
contact your Unstructured sales representative, email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io), or fill out the 
[contact form](https://unstructured.io/contact) on the Unstructured website, and a member of the Unstructured sales or support teams 
will get back to you as soon as possible to discuss self-hosting options.

## Concepts

Plugins are rather straightforward in they accept a named input and emit a named output. The following diagram illustrates this concept:

![Conceptual programmatic flow of plugins](/img/ui/Plugins-DAG.png)

In the preceding diagram:

- The blue boxes represent the default plugins that come with Unstructured.
- The yellow circles describe what each default plugin does.  
- The green box represents the indexer that gathers all of the source files.
- The red box represents the destination location.
- The arrows represent the flow of data between the plugins. 
- The words within the arrows represent the programmatic names of the inputs and outputs of the plugins. For example, 
  the **Partitioner** plugin accepts its input, represented by the programmatic name `doc_path`, from the previous plugin. 
  The **Partitioner** plugin emits its output, represented by the programmatic name `element_dicts` to the next plugin.
