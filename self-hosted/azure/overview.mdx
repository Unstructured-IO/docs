## Getting started

To get started with a self-hosted deployment, your organization must first sign a self-hosting agreement with Unstructured. 
This agreement outlines the terms and conditions for your organization to use Unstructured in a self-hosted environment.

To begin the self-hosting agreement process, contact your Unstructured sales representative, email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io), or fill out the 
[contact form](https://unstructured.io/contact) on the Unstructured website.

After your organization has signed the self-hosting agreement, a member of the Unstructured technical enablement team will reach out to you to begin the 
deployment onboarding process. To streamline this process, you are encouraged to begin setting up your target environment as soon as possible. To do this, 
see the [onboarding checkist](/self-hosted/azure/onboard).
