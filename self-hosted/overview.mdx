Unstructured offers _self-hosted_ deployments, which allow you to run the [Unstructured user interface](/ui/overview) (UI) 
and the [Unstructured API](/api-reference/overview) on infrastructure that you maintain in your 
[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](/self-hosted/aws/overview), [Azure](/self-hosted/azure/overview), or
[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](/self-hosted/gcp/overview) account.

Running Unstructured on your own cloud-based infrastructure provides benefits such as the following:

- _Security, privacy, and ownership_: Your organization might have strict data security requirements to keep your data and models within a virtual private cloud (VPC).
- _Compliance and data sovereignty_: Certain industries and locales might have regulatory requirements that require data to be processed and for data and models to be stored in specific cloud provider regions.
- _Customization_: Self-hosted deployments allow for more customization and control options over your environments.
- _Testing and development_: Self-hosted deployments can be useful for multi-environment testing and development purposes, allowing you to experiment with Unstructured in a testing environment without affecting your production environment.

## Getting started

To get started with a self-hosted deployment, your organization must first sign a self-hosting agreement with Unstructured. 
This agreement outlines the terms and conditions for your organization to use Unstructured in a self-hosted environment.

To begin the self-hosting agreement process, contact your Unstructured sales representative, email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io), or fill out the 
[contact form](https://unstructured.io/contact) on the Unstructured website.

After your organization has signed the self-hosting agreement, a member of the Unstructured technical enablement team will reach out to you to begin the 
deployment onboarding process. To streamline this process, you are encouraged to begin setting up your target environment as soon as possible. To do this, 
see the onboarding requirements for your [AWS](/self-hosted/aws/onboard), [Azure](/self-hosted/azure/onboard), or  
[GCP](/self-hosted/gcp/onboard) account.
