Unstructured offers _self-hosted_ deployments, which allow you to run Unstructured on infrastructure that you own or maintain yourself. This can be for a variety of reasons, including:

- _Security, privacy, and ownership_: Your organization might have strict data security requirements to keep your data and models on-premises or within a virtual private cloud (VPC).
- _Compliance and data sovereignty_: Certain industries and locales might have regulatory requirements that require data to be processed and for data and models to be stored in specific locations.
- _Performance_: For some use cases, running Unstructured on your own infrastructure can provide better performance due to reduced latency.
- _Customization_: Self-hosted deployments allow for more customization and control options over your environments.
- _Cost_: For large-scale deployments, running Unstructured on your own infrastructure can be more cost-effective than using a cloud service&mdash;or the other way around.
- _Cloud vendor lock-in_: Your organization might prefer to avoid cloud vendor lock-in by running Unstructured on its own infrastructure.
- _Testing and development_: Self-hosted deployments can be useful for testing and development purposes, allowing you to experiment with Unstructured in a testing environment without affecting your production environment.
- _Disaster recovery_: Your organization might want to have a self-hosted deployment as part of its disaster recovery plan, to ensure that you can continue to use Unstructured even if your cloud provider experiences an outage.

Unstructured offers self-hosted deployment options for your [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](/self-hosted/aws/overview), [Azure](/self-hosted/azure/overview), and 
[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](/self-hosted/gcp/overview) accounts. There is also a [bare-metal](/self-hosted/bare-metal/overview) deployment option 
if you want to run Unstructured on your own hardware.

## Getting started

To get started with a self-hosted deployment, your organization must first sign a self-hosting agreement with Unstructured. 
This agreement outlines the terms and conditions for your organization to use Unstructured in a self-hosted environment.

To begin the self-hosting agreement process, email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io), or fill out the 
[contact form](https://unstructured.io/contact) on the Unstructured website.

After your organization has signed the self-hosting agreement, a member of the Unstructured technical enablement team will reach out to you to begin the 
deployment onboarding process. To streamline this process, you are encouraged to begin setting up your target environment as soon as possible. To do this, 
see the onboarding requirements for your [AWS](/self-hosted/aws/onboard), [Azure](/self-hosted/azure/onboard), or  
[GCP](/self-hosted/gcp/onboard) account, or for your [bare-metal](/self-hosted/bare-metal/onboard) hardware.
