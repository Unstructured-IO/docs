title: Access to services

On Februrary 15, 2026, Unstructured stopped providing access to its services in specific locales, to 
customers enrolled in Unstructured's **Let's Go**, **Pay-As-You-Go**, and **Business SaaS** account plans. 
Unstructured made this decision after careful review, determining that the compliance and regulatory 
requirements associated with continuing to operate in these locales were no longer sustainable relative to 
the locales' usage and revenue levels at the time of the decision.

The list of affected locales is as follows:

- Andorra
- Angola
- Armenia
- Bangladesh
- Bermuda
- Brazil
- Chile
- China
- Colombia
- Congo

After February 15, 2026, organizations with large-scale needs may be able to continue accessing Unstructured through an Unstructured **dedicated instance** 
or **in-VPC** deployment that addresses the applicable compliance and regulatory requirements. If you are interested
