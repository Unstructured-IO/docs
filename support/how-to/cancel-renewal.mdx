---

If you are approaching the end of your annual Unstructured [Starter](https://unstructured.io/pricing) subscription, and you do not want to renew it for another year, 
you can request that Unstructured cancel the upcoming auto-renewal of your subscription.

To request that Unstructured cancel your annual subscription's upcoming auto-renewal, email Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io) 
with the following information:

- The email address of the primary contact for your Unstructured **Starter** subscription.
- The reason why you want to cancel the upcoming auto-renewal of your annual subscription.

After Unstructured Support receives your request, within one business day, they will cancel the upcoming auto-renewal of your annual subscription and 
then respond with an email to the primary contact, confirming the cancellation. If you have not received this cancellation confirmation email within 3 business days, 
you can email Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io) to check on the status of your request.

This process does not apply to Unstructured [Team](https://unstructured.io/pricing) or [Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/pricing) accounts. 
For questions, requests, or issues related to these account types, contact your assigned Unstructured Account Executive (AE). If you do not know who your assigned AE is, 
email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).
