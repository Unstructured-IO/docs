To raise an issue about an unpaid invoice that Unstructured has sent you, or to request a refund for an invoice that you have already paid, email Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).

In your email, include the following information:

- The email address of the primary contact for your Unstructured **Starter** subscription or **Team** or **Enterprise** agreement.
- The related invoice number.
- The monetary amount of the unpaid invoice that you are disputing, or the monetary amount of the already-paid invoice for which you are requesting a refund.
- The specific reasons why you are disputing the charges or requesting a refund.
- Any supporting details, documentation, or other information that helps support your claim.

After Unstructured Support receives your request, within one business day, they will respond with an email to the primary contact, acknowledging your 
dispute or refund request. If you have not received this acknowledgement email within 3 business days, you can email Unstructured Support at 
[support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io) to check on its status.

The timing and details for resolving the dispute or refund request will depend on the nature of the issue. If you have any follow-up questions about the issue 
or just want to check on its current status, email Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).
