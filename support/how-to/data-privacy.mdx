You can request that Unstructured delete the personal data that Unstructured stores in its systems about you, export that 
personal data and send a copy of it to you, or both.

To make a personal data deletion or export request, fill out and submit the 
[Data Privacy Request](https://na1.hs-data-privacy.com/request/UYsLQfVEBgaaIvrZb74_EA) webform.

After Unstructured receives your request, within one business day, they will delete the personal data that Unstructured stores in its 
systems about you or export that personal data. Unstructured will then send an email to the address listed on the webform&mdash;this email will 
confirm the deletion or provide a copy of the exported 
personal data, respectively. If you have not received this email within 3 business days, you can email Unstructured Support at 
[support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io) to check on the status of your request.

If you have any questions about this process or need help filling out or submitting the webform, email Unstructured Support at 
[support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).
