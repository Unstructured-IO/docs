<Tip>
    If you are having an issue with Unstructured, try checking the [Issues](/support/issues/overview) section first 
    to see if your issue has already been addressed.
</Tip>

To request support, do the following:

- If you are using the [Unstructured open source library](/open-source/introduction/overview), 
  request support by creating a new message in the **#general** 
  channel in the [Unstructured Slack community](https://short.unstructured.io/pzw05l7).
- For Unstructured software-as-a-service (Saas) accounts, including legacy pay-as-you-go, 
  [Let's Go](https://unstructured.io/pricing) and [Pay-As-You-Go](https://unstructured.io/pricing) accounts, 
  email Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).<sup>*</sup>
- For Unstructured [Business](/business/overview) accounts, 
  contact your assigned Unstructured Account Executive (AE) or Customer Success Manager (CSM) for access to your 
  dedicated Customer Support Portal. 
  If you do not know who your assigned AE or CSM is, 
  email Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).<sup>*</sup>

It is critical that you route your support requests appropriately, as follows. Incorrect routing can result in delayed or no response, and 
any related service level agreement (SLA) commitments by Unstructured will not be honored.

- **Support requests for paid Unstructured accounts (except for **Business** accounts) must only be emailed to Unstructured Support at 
  [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io)**. These kinds of support requests, if submitted by any other means, 
  might take longer to receive a response from Unstructured Support&mdash;or they might not be responded to at all.
- **Support requests for Unstructured **Business** accounts must only be directed to your 
  assigned Unstructured Account Executive (AE) or Customer Success Manager (CSM).** These kinds of support requests, if submitted by any other means, 
  might take longer to receive a response from Unstructured Support&mdash;or they might not be responded to at all.
- **Support requests for the Unstructured open source library must only be posted in the #general channel in the Unstructured Slack community**. 
  These kinds of support requests, if submitted by any other means, will not be responded to.

<sup>*</sup> Before contacting Unstructured Support, please ensure that you consult the 
latest version of the [Unstructured Shared Responsibility Model](/support/shared-responsibility) to check 
who owns resolution of the issue you are experiencing. If you contact Unstructured Support about an issue for 
which the Model states that the customer is ultimately responsible, Support could return the unresolved issue 
back to you and take no further action.
