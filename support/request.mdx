title: Requesting support
---

To request support, do the following:

- If you are using the [Unstructured open source library](/open-source/introduction/overview), 
  request support by creating a new message in the **#general** 
  channel in the [Unstructured Slack community](https://short.unstructured.io/pzw05l7).
- For Unstructured software-as-a-service (Saas) accounts, including legacy pay-as-you-go, 
  [Starter](https://unstructured.io/pricing) and [Team](https://unstructured.io/pricing) accounts, 
  email Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).<sup>*</sup>
- For Unstructured [Enterprise](/enterprise/overview) accounts, including dedicated instance and in-VPC accounts, 
  contact your assigned Unstructured Account Executive (AE) or Customer Success Manager (CSM) for access to your 
  dedicated Customer Support Portal. 
  If you do not know who your assigned AE or CSM is, 
  email Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).<sup>*</sup>

<sup>*</sup> Before contacting Unstructured Support, please ensure that you consult the 
latest version of the [Unstructured Shared Responsibility Model](/support/shared-responsibility) to check 
who owns resolution of the issue you are experiencing. If you contact Unstructured Support about an issue for 
which the Model states that the customer is ultimately responsible, Support could return the unresolved issue 
back to you and take no further action.
