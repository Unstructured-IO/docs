title: The Fast strategy is not available for image files
---

## Issue

When you try to run a workflow in Unstructured with the following settings:

- The workflow contains a **Partitioner** node set to use the **Fast** partitioning strategy.
- The workflow is configured to process an image file, such as a PNG or JPG file.

You get an error that contains text similar to the following, and the workflow fails to run:

```text
422: Error in partition - {"detail":"The fast strategy is not available for image files"}
```

## Cause

Unstructured is trying to process an image file&mdash;such as a PNG or JPG file&mdash;by using the **Fast** partitioning strategy, but 
this strategy is designed for text-based documents only and cannot analyze the layout of images.

## Solution

1. Change the workflow's**Partitioner** node's **Partition Strategy** setting to **Auto**, **High Res**, or **VLM**.
2. Re-run the workflow.

## Additional resources

- If your workflow is configured to process a mixture of file types, you should use the **Auto** partitioning strategy. Unstructured will then 
  automatically choose the best partitioning strategy for each file.
