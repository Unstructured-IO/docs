## Issues

When you try to connect Unstructured to a specifc source or destination, you get one of the following error types:

- `FileNotFoundError`: For example, for Amazon S3, a `path not found` error.
- `ClientRequestException`: For example, for OneDrive an `itemNotFound` error.
- `ValueError`: For example, for Google Drive, a `File not found` error. For Amazon S3, an `Invalid endpoint` error.
- `UserError`: For example, for Azure Blob Storage, a `DeploymentNotFound` error.
- `ParamValidationError`: For example, for Amazon S3, an `Invalid bucket name` error.
- `EndpointResolutionError`: For example, for Amazon S3, a `Custom endpoint not valid URI` error.
- `ProgrammingError`: For example, for Snowflake, a `No active warehouse selected` error.
- `UnboundLocalError`: For example, for SharePoint, a `cannot access 'site_drive_item'` error.
- `HTTPError`: For example, for Confluence, a `404 Not Found` error for a specific page or attachment URL.
- `KeyError`: For example, for Jira, an error containing the word 'total'. For Amazon S3, an error containing the word `Key`.

## Possible causes

- Unstructured is configured to interact with a resource&mdash;such as a file, path, deployment, endpoint, or database object&mdash;that doesn't exist, 
  is misnamed, or the configuration itself is invalid.
- There is a typo in a bucket name, folder path, file ID, deployment name, hostname, site path, or database name.
- The specified resource has been deleted or moved.
- An endpoint URL is incorrectly formatted, for example, is missing `https://` or contains invalid characters.
- An Amazon S3 bucket name is not formatted correctly.
- A required configuration is missing in the source or destination connector, for example, there no active Snowflake warehouse is specified.
- An Azure OpenAI deployment name is mismatched, failed, or does not exist.
- An invalid URL is specified for an attachment or a link within a source document.
- There is a specific configuration issue with a connector, for example, the specified SharePoint path does not lead to a valid drive.

## Possible solutions

- **Verify names and paths**: Carefully check all configured names, IDs, and paths&mdash;such as for buckets, folders, files, site, deployments, and endpoint URLs&mdash;for accuracy. Ensure they exist in the source and destination system. Case sensitivity often matters.
- **Check formatting**: Ensure that URLs, bucket names, and other parameters adhere to the required format.
- **Verify that the resource exists**: Confirm that the target file, folder, deployment, or other resource exists and has not been moved or deleted.
- **Check configuration dependencies**: Ensure the necessary configurations are set in the source or destination, for example, select and start a Snowflake warehouse by running the `USE WAREHOUSE` command first.
- For **Azure OpenAI**: Double-check that the Deployment Name matches a successful deployment in your Azure portal.
- For **Confluence**: If a `404` error occurs during download, check if the page or attachment link is valid within Confluence itself.
- For **SharePoint**: Verify the Site Path leads to a valid location containing document libraries.
- **Reconfigure the connector**: Review and, as needed, correct any misconfigured settings in the source or destination connector.
