title: Google Drive schema validation failure
---

## Issue

When you save and test a Google Drive source connector, you get an error that contains text similar to the following:

```text
Schema validation failure for GoogleDriveConnectionConfig: 
Value error, Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0) at 
access_config,service_account_key got -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
...
```

Although you can finish creating and saving this connector, the connection test fails, and you cannot successfully run any 
workflows that use this failed connector.

## Cause

You have configured the Google Drive source connector with the Google Drive service account's key in an incorrect format. 
You likely have specified only a portion of the file, such as just the private key part. Unstructured expects the entire contents 
of the Google Drive service account's key file. 

## Solution

1. Find the original Google Drive service account's key file in JSON format, which you downloaded earlier from your Google Cloud account when 
   you originally created the Google Drive source connector.
2. Open the file in a text editor such as Notepad, Visual Studio Code, or TextEdit.
3. Copy everything in the file, starting from the first opening brace `{` to the final closing brace `}`.
4. In the original Google Drive source connector's settings, delete the original contents of the **Service Account Key** field, and paste 
   the complete JSON content that you just copied.
5. Save the changes and re-test and re-save the connector.

## Additional resources

- If the connector test still fails, try using a tool such as `tr` for macOS or Linux, or PowerShell for Windows, to copy 
  the entire contents of the file, instead of a text editor, as follows:

  - For macOS or Linux: 

    ```text
    tr -d '\n' < <path-to-downloaded-key-file>
    ```

  - For Windows:

    ```text
    (Get-Content -Path "<path-to-downloaded-key-file>" -Raw).Replace("`r`n", "").Replace("`n", "")
    ```
