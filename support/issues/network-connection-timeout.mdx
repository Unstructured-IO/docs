title: Network, connection, and timeout issues
---

## Issues

When you try to establish or maintain a network connections between Unstructured and an external system, you get one of the following error types:

- `ReadTimeout`
- `TimeoutError`
- `ServerDisconnectedError`
- `ClientConnectorError`: For example, a `cannot connect to localhost` error.
- `ConnectionError`: For example, a `Failed to resolve 'model-registry-api...` error.
- `ServiceResponseError`: For example, for Azure, a `Timeout on reading data from socket` error.
- `ClientPayloadError`: For example, a `Response payload not completed` or `Connection reset by peer` error.
- `OSError`: For example, for Amazon S3 during a file upload, an `[Errno 22] The request body terminated unexpectedly` error.

## Possible causes

- Unstructured failed to connect to a required system.
- The connection timed out while waiting for a response.
- An established connection was unexpectedly closed.
- Transient network issues were encountered with the local network, with the Internet, or with a cloud provider.
- Firewalls are blocking connections. 
- Some services are temporarily unavailable, slow, or unresponsive.
- The processing of very large files are causing long-running operations, which lead to exceeding default timeouts.
- Issues with DNS resolutions were encountered.

## Possible solutions

- **Retry the job**: Many network errors are transient. Wait a few minutes and then retry the job.
- **Check network connectivity**: Ensure stable network connectivity with the related source and destination systems.
- **Check firewalls**: Verify that any firewalls are not blocking necessary connections to source or destination APIs, blob storage, databases, vector stores, or ports.
- **Process smaller batches or files**: If timeouts occur during processing or uploading very large files, try using smaller files or batches.
- **Contact Unstructured Support**: For persistent `ClientConnectorError`, `ConnectionError`, or other frequent timeouts or disconnects that aren't resolved by retries, [contact Unstructured Support](/support/request). These issues can sometimes point to internal Unstructured system problems.
