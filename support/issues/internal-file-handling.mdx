## Issues

Unstructured returns one of the following error types:

- `NotFoundException`: For example, an error retrieving intermediate file data from internal storage, with a pattern such as `/f8c6.../element_dicts/...json`.
- `FileNotFoundError`: For example, an error with internal system paths that use a pattern such as `/home/etl/node/staged/...` or `/home/etl/node/downloads/...`.
- `ValueError`: For example, a `Failed to decrypt secret` error.
- `AttributeError`: For example, a `'TimeoutError' object has no attribute 'status_code'` error.
- `asyncio.exceptions.CancelledError`

## Possible causes

- There is an error in a previous workflow or ingestion pipeline stage within Unstructured's environment that is preventing intermediate files from being created correctly.
- There are file system or storage issues within Unstructured's environment.
- There are problems with Unstructured's internal management of secret keys or configurations.
- There are issues with Unstructured's internal error handling or service lifecycle management.
- There are some other general issues with Unstructured's internal workings, often related to managing temporary files or internal state.

## Possible solutions

- **Retry the job**: Retry the entire job, as the issue might have been temporary.
- **Contact Unstructured Support**: These issues are generally fixable only by Unstructured. These issues typically indicate internal issues that customers cannot fix themselves. 
  Be sure when you [contact Unstructured Support](/support/request) to include the full error message, timestamp, and job details.
