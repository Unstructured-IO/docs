title: Unable to sign up with personal email address
---

## Issue

When you try to [sign up for a free Unstructured account](https://unstructured.io/?modal=try-for-free), and you enter a personal email address into 
the **Company email** field in the sign-up form, the following error message appears:

```text
Please enter a different email address. This form does not accept addresses from <domain>.
```

This error message prevents you from clicking **Submit** to sign up for a free Unstructured account.

## Cause

Unstructured does not accept email addresses from free domains (such as Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook, and Yahoo) when signing up for a free Unstructured account.

## Solution

Use a company email address when signing up for a free Unstructured account.
