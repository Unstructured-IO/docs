title: Workflow already has a job scheduled or in progress
---

## Issue

When you try to run a workflow, you get a warning message that contains text similar to the following:

```text
Failed to schedule job for workflow ... Workflow already has a job scheduled or in progress. Retrying in 60 seconds.
```

## Causes

- Unstructured tried to start a new job run for the workflow, but the previous job run for that workflow is stuck or has otherwise not finished yet.
- The workflow's schedule is too frequent for how long the job takes to run. For example, the workflow might be scheduled to 
  run every 5 minutes, but each job run for that workflow typically takes 10 minutes or longer to complete.

## Solutions

- Unstructured will wait and try the new job run again in 60 seconds.
- Check previous job runs for the workflow to see if any of them are stuck. If so, try to cancel them.
- Check previous job runs for the workflow to see if any of them seem to be running much longer than usual. If so,
  consider adjusting the workflow's schedule to run less frequently. Or, temporarily turn off the workflow's schedule and then run the workflow manually as needed.
