title: S3 destination connector - Unable to locate credentials
---

## Issue

When you try to run a workflow in Unstructured, and the workflow contains an Amazon S3 destination connector, 
you get an error that contains text similar to one of the following, and the workflow fails to run:

```text
500: Error in uploader - [NoCredentialsError] Unable to locate credentials 
```

```text
failed to invoke plugin: Unable to locate credentials
```

## Possible causes

- Unstructured tried to save its processed data to the specific Amazon S3 bucket, but Unstructured could not find the necessary 
  security keys or other credentials to get access to that bucket.
- The specified AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key are missing from your S3 destination connector configuration.
- The specified credentials are incorrect, have been revoked, or have expired.
- The S3 destination connector is configured to use a temporary IAM role, but that role does not have permission to write to the target bucket.

## Possible solutions

- Double-check that your workflow's Amazon S3 destination connector has the correct, valid credentials specified.
- Confirm that the specified credentials are still present and valid in your AWS account.
- If your organization uses IAM roles, contact your platform administrator to ensure the role has `s3:PutObject` permissions for the bucket you are trying to use.

## Additional resources

- Always copy and paste security keys and other credentials carefully.
- If possible, use your organization's secrets manager to handle security keys and other credentials automatically.
