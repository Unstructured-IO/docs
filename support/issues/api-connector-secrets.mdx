title: Google Drive source connectors cannot be created by using the API
---

## Issue

When you try to use the [Unstructured Workflow Endpoint](/api-reference/workflow/overview) to 
[create a source connector](/api-reference/workflow/overview#create-a-source-connector) 
that connects [Google Drive](/api-reference/workflow/sources/google-drive) to Unstructured, 
an error similar to the following occurs, and the source connector is not created:

```text
API error occurred: Status 412. Body: {
    "errors": [
        {
            "field": "access_config.service_account_key",
            "message": "Field is sensitive and must be wrapped in as a secret reference or new secret value"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Cause

This error occurs because the contents of the caller's Google Drive service account's `credentials.json` file (or its 
equivalent JSON string representation) must be specially encrypted and formatted before these contents are sent to Unstructured, due to the contents' size. 
However, the Unstructured Workflow Endpoint does not support this special encryption and formatting process.

## Solution

Use the [Unstructured user interface (UI)](/ui/overview) to [create a Google Drive source connector](/ui/sources/google-drive) instead, as 
the Unstructured UI does support this special encryption and formatting process.
