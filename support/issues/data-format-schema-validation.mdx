title: Data format, schema, and validation issues

## Issues

When Unstructured tries to process or transfer data, you get one of the following error types:

- `ValidationError`: For example, `S3ConnectionConfig`, `PluginResponse`, or `filedata_meta input type` errors.
- `ClientResponseError`: For example, an `HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity` error.
- `ListConversionException`: For example, for Pinecone, an `Expected list, got None` error.
- `ServerOperationError`: For example, for Databricks, an `UNRESOLVED_COLUMN` error.
- `WeaviateDeleteManyError`: For example, a `no such prop with name 'record_id'` error.
- `CollectionInsertManyException`: For example, for Astra DB, a `vector dimension mismatch` error.
- `TypeError`: For example, for Pinecone, a `PineconeUploader missing argument` error.
- `UserError`: For example, a wrappingschema validation failure.

## Possible causes

- The data being processed or transferred doesn't match the expected structure, format, or validation rules.
- The data provided in configuration or during processing is not valid. 
- The data being sent to a destination doesn't match the destination's schema&mdash;for example, the data has missing fields, wrong data types, or an incorrect number of vector dimensions.
- Incorrect configuration values were provided&mdash;for example, a non-string token was provided where a string was expected instead.
- There is a schema mismatch between the data generated by Unstructured and the destination schema&mdash;for example, missing columns or properties, or wrong data types.
- The specified embedding model generates vectors of a different dimension than the destination index or collection is configured for.
- The data was generated in an unexpected format.

## Possible solutions

- **Verify the data configuration**: Double-check configuration parameters against the relevant documentation for the correct data format and type.
- **Verify the destination schema**: Ensure that the schema&dash;including columns, properties, types, and vector dimensions&mdash;in the destination's system matches the data being sent. You might need to update or recreate the destination schema.
- **Check the data fields**: Check if fields such as `record_id`, `element_id`, `text`, `embeddings`, and `metadata` are expected and present.
- **Verify the embedding dimensions**: Confirm that the specified embedding model produces vectors of the dimension expected by the destination collection or index.
- **Contact Unstructured Support**: For `HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity` errors where the cause isn't clear, `ListConversionException` errors, `TypeError` errors, or persistent schema mismatch issues after verification, [contact Unstructured Support](/support/request).
