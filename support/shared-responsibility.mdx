title: Shared Responsibility Model
---

The Unstructured Shared Responsibility Model defines the division of ownership and duties between 
Unstructured, customers, and the cloud service providers (CSPs) that Unstructured and customers rely on.

The Model lists and clarifies who is ultimately responsible for specific aspects of 
physical and cloud infrastructure, security, and application services, ensuring each party understands 
not only its own obligations but the obligations of the other participating parties. This Model is 
regularly updated to reflect the latest additions and changes to Unstructured's and the 
CSPs' product and service offerings.

Before you contact Unstructured Support, you are encouraged to review the latest version of the Model 
to check who owns resolution of the issue you are experiencing. If you contact 
Unstructured Support about an issue for which the Model states that the customer is ultimately responsible, 
Support could return the unresolved issue back to you and take no further action.

To see the latest version of the Model, go to the [Unstructured Trust Portal](https://trust.unstructured.io/), 
scroll down to the "Topics and common questions" section, and expand the entry labelled 
"Shared Responsibility Model."
