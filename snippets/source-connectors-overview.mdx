Connect to your favorite data storage platforms for effortless batch processing of your files. We are constantly adding
new data connectors and if you donâ€™t see your favorite platform let us know in our community Slack.

When ingesting data from a storage via a source connector, you typically store the resulting `*.json` files in a
specified output directory.

To "rehydrate" elements in JSON form into in-memory objects to further use in your application, use `elements_from_json`:

```python
from unstructured.staging.base import elements_from_json

elements = elements_from_json(filename=path_to_json_file)
```
