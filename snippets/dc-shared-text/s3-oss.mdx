Batch process all your records to store structured outputs in an S3 bucket.

You will need:

import SharedS3 from '/snippets/general-shared-text/s3.mdx';

<SharedS3 />

The source connector can be any of the ones supported. This example uses the local source connector:

import S3Sh from '/snippets/destination_connectors/s3.sh.mdx';
import S3Py from '/snippets/destination_connectors/s3.py.mdx';

<CodeGroup>

  <S3Sh />

  <S3Py />

</CodeGroup>
