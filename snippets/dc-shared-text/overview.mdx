Ingest and process data from a storage with a source connector, and move the results to the data storage platform of
your choice using a destination connector.

All the examples for destination connector use local source connector. You can replace it with any other source connector.

We are constantly adding new destination connectors and if you don't see your favorite platform let us know in our community Slack.
