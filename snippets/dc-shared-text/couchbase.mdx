Batch process all your records using `unstructured-ingest` to store structured outputs locally on your filesystem and upload those local files to a Couchbase collection.

First, install the Couchbase dependencies as shown here.

```bash
pip install "unstructured[couchbase]"
```

The upstream connector can be any of the ones supported, but for convenience here, showing a sample command using the upstream local connector.

import CouchbaseSh from '/snippets/destination_connectors/couchbase.sh.mdx';
import CouchbasePy from '/snippets/destination_connectors/couchbase.py.mdx';

<CodeGroup>

  <CouchbaseSh />

  <CouchbasePy />

</CodeGroup>


For a full list of the options the CLI accepts check `unstructured-ingest <upstream connector> couchbase --help`.

NOTE: Keep in mind that you will need to have all the appropriate extras and dependencies for the file types of the documents contained in your data storage platform if youâ€™re running this locally. You can find more information about this in the [installation guide](/open-source/installation/overview).
