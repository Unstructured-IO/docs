Batch process all your records using `unstructured-ingest` to store unstructured outputs locally on your filesystem and upload those to Clarifai apps.

First start with the installation of clarifai dependencies as shown here.

```bash
pip install "unstructured[clarifai]"
```

Create a clarifai app with base workflow. Find more information in the [create clarifai app](https://docs.clarifai.com/clarifai-basics/applications/create-an-application/).

import ClarifaiSh from '/snippets/destination_connectors/clarifai.sh.mdx';
import ClarifaiPy from '/snippets/destination_connectors/clarifai.py.mdx';

The upstream connector can be any of the ones supported, but for the convenience here, showing a sample command using the upstream local connector.

For a full list of the options the CLI accepts check `unstructured-ingest <upstream connector> clarifai --help`.

NOTE: Keep in mind that you will need to have all the appropriate extras and dependencies for the file types of the documents contained in your data storage platform if youâ€™re running this locally. You can find more information about this in the [installation guide](/open-source/installation/overview).
