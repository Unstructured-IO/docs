Batch process all your records to store structured outputs in an S3 bucket.

You will need: 

- The S3 connector dependencies:

  ```bash CLI, Python SDK
  pip install "unstructured[s3]"
  ```

- These environment variables:

  - `AWS_S3_URL` - The S3 remote URL, formatted as `protocol://dir/path/` (for example, `s3://my-bucket/my-folder/`).
  - If your S3 bucket doesn't allow anonymous access, provide your AWS credentials:

    - `--key` (CLI) or `key` (Python SDK) - The AWS access key ID, represented as `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`.
    - `--secret` (CLI) or `secret` (Python SDK) - Your AWS secret access key, represented as `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

    If your S3 bucket allows access without local AWS credentials, set `--anonymous` (CLI) or `anonymous=True` (Python SDK) instead.

  - `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` - Your Unstructured API key value.
  - `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` - Your Unstructured API URL.


The source connector can be any of the ones supported. This example the local source connector:

import S3Sh from '/snippets/destination_connectors/s3_api.sh.mdx';
import S3PyV2 from '/snippets/destination_connectors/s3_api.v2.py.mdx';
import S3PyV1 from '/snippets/destination_connectors/s3_api.v1.py.mdx';

  <S3PyV2 />

  <S3PyV1 />
