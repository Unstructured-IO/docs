Batch process all your records to store structured outputs in a Delta Table in Databricks.

The Delta Table in Databricks connector provides two implementations:

- The _SQL-based_ implementation enables you to have Unstructured write its processed data directly to a table in Unity Catalog.
- The _volume-based_ implementation enables you to have Unstructured write its processed data as a file to a volume in Unity Catalog. Unstructured then 
  uses that file in the volume to write the file's data to a table in Unity Catalog. The file remains in the volume.

The requirements are as follows.

import SharedDatabricksDeltaTable from '/snippets/general-shared-text/databricks-delta-table.mdx';
import SharedDatabricksDeltaTableCLIAPI from '/snippets/general-shared-text/databricks-delta-table-cli-api.mdx';
