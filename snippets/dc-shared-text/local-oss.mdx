Batch process all your records to store structured outputs locally.

You will need the local destination connector dependencies:

```bash CLI, Python SDK
pip install unstructured
```

To use the local destination connector, you must set `--output-dir` (CLI) or `output_dir` (Python SDK) to the path in the local filesystem which will contain the structured output.
