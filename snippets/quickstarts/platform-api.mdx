This quickstart uses the Unstructured Python SDK to get all of your data RAG-ready. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

The requirements are as follows.

- A compatible source (input) location that contains your data for Unstructured to process. [See the list of supported source types](/platform/connectors#sources).
- For document-based source locations, compatible files in that location. [See the list of supported file types](/platform/supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.
- A compatible destination (output) location for Unstructured to put the processed data. [See the list of supported destination types](/platform/connectors#destinations).

<Steps>
    <Step title="Sign up">
        To sign up for the Unstructured Platform, go to the [For Developers](https://unstructured.io/developers) page and choose one of the following plans:

        - Sign up for a [pay-per-page plan](https://unstructured.io/developers#get-started).
        - Save money by signing up for a [subscribe-and-save plan](https://unstructured.io/subscribeandsave) instead.

        If you're not sure which plan to sign up for, start with a [pay-per-page plan](https://unstructured.io/developers#get-started). You can always switch plans later.

        <Note>
            If you choose a pay-per-page plan, after your first 14 days of usage or more than 1000 processed pages per day, 
            whichever comes first, your account is then billed at Unstructured's standard service usage rates. To keep using the service, 
            you must 
            [provide Unstructured with your payment details](/platform/billing#add-view-or-change-pay-per-page-payment-details).
            
            To save money by switching from a pay-per-page to a subscribe-and-save plan, go to the 
            [Unstructured Subscribe & Save](https://unstructured.io/subscribeandsave) page and complete the on-screen instructions. 
            To save even more money by making a long-term billing commitment, 
            stop here and sign up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead.
            
            By signing up for a pay-per-page or subscribe-and-save plan, your Unstructured account will run within the context of the Unstructured Platform on 
            Unstructured's own hosted cloud resources. If you would rather run the Unstructured Platform within the context of your own virtual private cloud (VPC), 
            stop here and sign up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead.
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Sign in">
        <Note>
            If you initially signed up for a subscribe-and-save plan instead of a pay-per-page plan, wait to complete this step until after you receive confirmation from Unstructured that your 
            plan is activated. Then go to the Unstructured home page at [https://unstructured.io](https://unstructured.io) and click **Login**.

            If you signed up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead, your sign-in process will 
            be different. For enterprise sign-in guidance, contact Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).
        </Note>

        1. After you have signed up for a pay-per-page plan, the Unstructured Platform sign-in page appears.

           ![Sign in to your Unstructured account](/img/platform/Signin.png)
        
        2. Click **Google** or **GitHub** to sign in with the Google or GitHub account that you signed up with. 
           Or, enter the email address that you signed up with, and then click **Sign In**.
        3. If you entered your email address, check your email inbox for a message from Unstructured. In that email, click the **Sign In** link.
        4. The first time you sign in, read the terms and conditions, and then click **Accept**.

        <Tip>
            After you have signed in for the first time, you can 
            sign in the second time and beyond by going to the Unstructured home page at [https://unstructured.io](https://unstructured.io) and clicking **Login**.
        
            For enterprise sign-in guidance, contact Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).

    <Step title="Get and set your API key">
        ![Unstructured account settings](/img/platform/AccountSettings.png)

        ![Unstructured API key URL](/img/platform/APIKeyURL.png)
        1. At the bottom of the sidebar, click your user icon, and then click **Account Settings**.
        2. Click the **API Keys** tab, if it is not already selected.
        3. To get your API key, click the copy icon in the **Actions** column for your API key, and then click **Key Only**. Store your copied API key in a secure location. Do not share it with others.
        4. From your Python virtual environment, Set an environment variable named `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` to the value of your Unstructured API key.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install the Unstructured Python SDK">
        Run the following command from your Python virtual environment:
        ```bash
        pip install unstructured-client
        ```
        <AdditionalIngestDependencies />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create the source connector">
        Add the following code to an empty `.py` file to create the source connector. In this code, replace the following placeholders:

        ```python Python
        # TODO: Code goes here.
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create the destination connector">
        Add the following code to create the destination connector. In this code, replace the following placeholders:

        ```python Python
        # TODO: Code goes here.
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create the workflow">
        Add the following code to create the workflow that uses the source and destination connectors. In this code, replace the following placeholders:
