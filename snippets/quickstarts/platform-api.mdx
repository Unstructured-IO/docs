This quickstart uses the Unstructured Python SDK to call the Unstructured Workflow Endpoint to get your data RAG-ready. The Python code for this 
quickstart is in a remote hosted Google Collab notebook. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

The requirements are as follows:

- A compatible source (input) location that contains your data for Unstructured to process. [See the list of supported source types](/ui/connectors#sources). 
  This quickstart uses an Amazon S3 bucket as the source location. If you use a different source type, you will need to modify the quickstart notebook accordingly.
- For document-based source locations, compatible files in that location. [See the list of supported file types](/ui/supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the `Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest` repository in GitHub.
- A compatible destination (output) location for Unstructured to put the processed data. [See the list of supported destination types](/ui/connectors#destinations). 
  For this quickstart's destination location, a different folder in the same Amazon S3 bucket as the source location is used. If you use a different destination S3 bucket or a different destination type, you will need to modify the quickstart notebook accordingly.

    <Step title="Create and set up the S3 bucket">
        This quickstart uses an Amazon S3 bucket as both the source location and the destination location. 
        (You can use other source and destination types that are supported by Unstructured. 
        If you use a different source or destination type, or if you use a different S3 bucket for the destination location, 
        you will need to modify the quickstart notebook accordingly.)
        
        Inside of the S3 bucket, a folder named `input` represents the 
        source location. This is where your files to be processed will be stored. 
        The S3 URI to the source location will be `s3://<your-bucket-name>/input`.
        
        Inside of the same S3 bucket, a folder inside named `output` represents the destination location. This 
        is where Unstructured will put the processed data. 
        The S3 URI to the destination location will be `s3://<your-bucket-name>/output`.

    <Step title="Run the quickstart notebook">
       After your S3 bucket is created and set up, follow the instructions in this [quickstart notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13f5C9WtUvIPjwJzxyOR3pNJ9K9vnF4ww).
    </Step>
    <Step title="View the processed data">
        After you run the quickstart notebook, go to your destination location to view the processed data.
