This quickstart uses the Unstructured Python SDK to call the Unstructured Workflow Endpoint to get your data RAG-ready. The Python code for this 
quickstart is in a remote hosted Google Collab notebook. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

The requirements are as follows:

- A compatible source (input) location that contains your data for Unstructured to process. [See the list of supported source types](/ui/connectors#sources). 
  This quickstart uses an Amazon S3 bucket as the source location. If you use a different source type, you will need to modify the quickstart notebook accordingly.
- For document-based source locations, compatible files in that location. [See the list of supported file types](/ui/supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the `Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest` repository in GitHub.
- A compatible destination (output) location for Unstructured to put the processed data. [See the list of supported destination types](/ui/connectors#destinations). 
  For this quickstart's destination location, a different folder in the same Amazon S3 bucket as the source location is used. If you use a different destination S3 bucket or a different destination type, you will need to modify the quickstart notebook accordingly.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Sign up">
        To sign up for Unstructured, go to the [For Developers](https://unstructured.io/developers) page and choose one of the following plans:

        - Sign up for a [pay-per-page plan](https://unstructured.io/developers#get-started).
        - Save money by signing up for a [subscribe-and-save plan](https://unstructured.io/subscribeandsave) instead.

        If you're not sure which plan to sign up for, start with a [pay-per-page plan](https://unstructured.io/developers#get-started). You can always switch plans later.

        <Note>
            If you choose a pay-per-page plan, after your first 14 days of usage or more than 1000 processed pages per day, 
            whichever comes first, your account is then billed at Unstructured's standard service usage rates. To keep using the service, 
            you must 
            [provide Unstructured with your payment details](/ui/billing#add-view-or-change-pay-per-page-payment-details).
            
            To save money by switching from a pay-per-page to a subscribe-and-save plan, go to the 
            [Unstructured Subscribe & Save](https://unstructured.io/subscribeandsave) page and complete the on-screen instructions. 
            To save even more money by making a long-term billing commitment, 
            stop here and sign up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead.
            
            By signing up for a pay-per-page or subscribe-and-save plan, your Unstructured account will run within the context of Unstructured on 
            Unstructured's own hosted cloud resources. If you would rather run Unstructured within the context of your own virtual private cloud (VPC), 
            stop here and sign up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead.

    <Step title="Sign in">
        <Note>
            If you initially signed up for a subscribe-and-save plan instead of a pay-per-page plan, wait to complete this step until after you receive confirmation from Unstructured that your 
            plan is activated. Then go to the Unstructured home page at [https://unstructured.io](https://unstructured.io) and click **Login**.

            If you signed up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead, your sign-in process will 
            be different. For enterprise sign-in guidance, contact Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).
        </Note>

        1. After you have signed up for a pay-per-page plan, the Unstructured account sign-in page appears.

        <Tip>
            After you have signed in for the first time, you can 
            sign in the second time and beyond by going to the Unstructured home page at [https://unstructured.io](https://unstructured.io) and clicking **Login**.

    <Step title="Create and set up the S3 bucket">
        This quickstart uses an Amazon S3 bucket as both the source location and the destination location. 
        (You can use other source and destination types that are supported by Unstructured. 
        If you use a different source or destination type, or if you use a different S3 bucket for the destination location, 
        you will need to modify the quickstart notebook accordingly.)
        
        Inside of the S3 bucket, a folder named `input` represents the 
        source location. This is where your files to be processed will be stored. 
        The S3 URI to the source location will be `s3://<your-bucket-name>/input`.
        
        Inside of the same S3 bucket, a folder inside named `output` represents the destination location. This 
        is where Unstructured will put the processed data. 
        The S3 URI to the destination location will be `s3://<your-bucket-name>/output`.

        Learn how to [create an S3 bucket and set it up for Unstructured](/api-reference/workflow/sources/s3). (Do not run the Python SDK code or REST commands at the end of those setup instructions.)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the quickstart notebook">
       After your S3 bucket is created and set up, follow the instructions in this [quickstart notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13f5C9WtUvIPjwJzxyOR3pNJ9K9vnF4ww).
    </Step>
    <Step title="View the processed data">
        After you run the quickstart notebook, go to your destination location to view the processed data.
