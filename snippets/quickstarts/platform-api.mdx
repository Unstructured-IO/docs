This quickstart uses the Unstructured Python SDK to call the Unstructured API's workflow operations to get your data RAG-ready. The Python code for this 
quickstart is in a remote hosted Google Colab notebook. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources. This notebook requires no local setup.

To run this quickstart, open the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Unstructured-IO/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/.ipynb) and begin following the notebook's on-screen instructions.

<Note>
    This walkthrough focuses on local file processing only for ease-of-use demonstration purposes.
    
    To use the Unstructured Python SDK for remote file processing, which requires you to also set up connectors to source and 
    destination locations, try the [walkthrough](/api-reference/workflow/overview#walkthrough) instead.
