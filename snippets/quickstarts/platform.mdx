This quickstart uses a no-code, point-and-click user interface in your web browser to get all of your data RAG-ready. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

The requirements are as follows.

- A compatible source (input) location that contains your data for Unstructured to process. [See the list of supported source types](/platform/connectors#sources).
- For document-based source locations, compatible files in that location. [See the list of supported file types](/platform/supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.
- A compatible destination (output) location for Unstructured to put the processed data. [See the list of supported destination types](/platform/connectors#destinations).

<Steps>
    <Step title="Sign up">
        To sign up for the Unstructured Platform, go to the [For Developers](https://unstructured.io/developers) page and enter your information.

        <Note>
            By signing up through the [For Developers](https://unstructured.io/developers) page, your Unstructured account will run within the context of the Unstructured Platform on 
            Unstructured's own hosted cloud resources. Also, after your first 14 days of usage or more than 1000 processed pages per day, 
            whichever comes first, your account is then billed at Unstructured's standard service usage rates. You can always 
            start a prepaid subscription in exchange for usage rate discounts. To switch your account from a pay-as-you-go plan to a prepaid subscription, 
            contact Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).
            
            If you would rather run the Unstructured Platform within the context of your own virtual private cloud (VPC), 
            or you want to make a long-term billing commitment in exchange for deeply discounted service usage rates, 
            stop here and sign up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead.
        </Note>

           <Note>
              If you signed up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead, your sign-in process will 
              be different. For enterprise sign-in guidance, contact Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).

        <Tip>
            After you have signed in through the [For Developers](https://unstructured.io/developers) page for the first time, you can 
            sign in the second time and beyond by going to the Unstructured home page at [https://unstructured.io](https://unstructured.io) and clicking **Login**.

        2. Click **Destinations**.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Define the workflow">
        ![Workflows in the sidebar](/img/platform/Workflows-Sidebar.png)
        1. In the sidebar, click **Workflows**.
        2. Click **New Workflow**.
        3. Next to **Build it with me**, click **Create Workflow**.

           <Note>If a radio button appears instead of **Build it with me**, select it, and then click **Continue**.</Note>

        4. For **Workflow Name**, enter some unique name for this workflow.
        5. In the **Sources** dropdown list, select your source location from Step 3.
        6. In the **Destinations** dropdown list, select your destination location from Step 4.

           <Note>You can select multiple source and destination locations. Files will be ingested from all of the selected source locations, and the processed data will be delivered to all of the selected destination locations.</Note>

        7. Click **Continue**.
        8. In the **Optimize for** section, select the option to choose one of these preconfigured workflow settings groups:

            - **Basic**: Ideal for simple, text-only documents.
            - **Advanced**: Best for PDFs, images, and complex file types.
            - **Platinum**: For your most challenging documents, including scanned and handwritten content. It uses vision language models (VLMs). 
              During processing, files that are not PDFs or images are processed by using the **Advanced** strategy and are charged at the **Advanced** rate instead.

              <Note>
                When you use the **Platinum** strategy for PDF files of 200 or more pages, you might notice some errors when 
                these files are processed. These errors typically occur when these larger PDF files have lots of tables and high-resolution images.
              </Note>

        9. The **Reprocess all** box applies only to blob storage connectors such as the Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage connectors:

           - Checking this box reprocesses all documents in the source location on every workflow run.
           - Unchecking this box causes new documents that have been added to the source location, as well as existing documents in the source location that have had their contents or titles changed, since the last workflow run to be processed on future runs. Other previously processed documents are not processed again.

        10. If you want to retry processing any documents that failed to process, check the **Retry Failed Documents** box.
        11. Click **Continue**.
        12. If you want this workflow to run on a schedule, in the **Repeat Run** dropdown list, select one of the scheduling options, and fill in the scheduling settings. Otherwise, select **Don't repeat**.
        13. Click **Complete**.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Process the documents">
