This quickstart uses a no-code, point-and-click user interface in your web browser to get all of your data RAG-ready. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

The requirements are as follows.

- A compatible source (input) location that contains your data for Unstructured to process. [See the list of supported source types](/ui/connectors#sources).
- For document-based source locations, compatible files in that location. [See the list of supported file types](/ui/supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.
- A compatible destination (output) location for Unstructured to put the processed data. [See the list of supported destination types](/ui/connectors#destinations).
