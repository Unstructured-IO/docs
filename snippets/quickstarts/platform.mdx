This quickstart uses a no-code, point-and-click user interface in your web browser to get all of your data RAG-ready. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

The requirements are as follows.

- A compatible source (input) location that contains your data for Unstructured to process. [See the list of supported source types](/platform/connectors#sources).
- For document-based source locations, compatible files in that location. [See the list of supported file types](/platform/supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.
- A compatible destination (output) location for Unstructured to put the processed data. [See the list of supported destination types](/platform/connectors#destinations).

<Steps>
    <Step title="Sign up">
        To sign up for the Unstructured Platform, go to the [For Developers](https://unstructured.io/developers) page and choose one of the following plans:

        - Sign up for a [pay-per-page plan](https://unstructured.io/developers#get-started).
        - Save money by signing up for a [subscribe-and-save plan](https://unstructured.io/subscribeandsave) instead.

        If you're not sure which plan to sign up for, start with a [pay-per-page plan](https://unstructured.io/developers#get-started). You can always switch plans later.

        <Note>
            If you choose a pay-per-page plan, after your first 14 days of usage or more than 1000 processed pages per day, 
            whichever comes first, your account is then billed at Unstructured's standard service usage rates. To keep using the service, 
            you must 
            [provide Unstructured with your payment details](/platform/billing#add-view-or-change-pay-per-page-payment-details).
            
            To save money by switching from a pay-per-page to a subscribe-and-save plan, go to the 
            [Unstructured Subscribe & Save](https://unstructured.io/subscribeandsave) page and complete the on-screen instructions. 
            To save even more money by making a long-term billing commitment, 
            stop here and sign up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead.
            
            By signing up for a pay-per-page or subscribe-and-save plan, your Unstructured account will run within the context of the Unstructured Platform on 
            Unstructured's own hosted cloud resources. If you would rather run the Unstructured Platform within the context of your own virtual private cloud (VPC), 
            stop here and sign up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead.
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Sign in">
        <Note>
            If you initially signed up for a subscribe-and-save plan instead of a pay-per-page plan, wait to complete this step until after you receive confirmation from Unstructured that your 
            plan is activated. Then go to the Unstructured home page at [https://unstructured.io](https://unstructured.io) and click **Login**.

            If you signed up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead, your sign-in process will 
            be different. For enterprise sign-in guidance, contact Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).
        </Note>

        1. After you have signed up for a pay-per-page plan, the Unstructured Platform sign-in page appears.

        <Tip>
            After you have signed in for the first time, you can
