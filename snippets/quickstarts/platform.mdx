The following quickstart shows you how to use the Unstructured UI to process remote files (or data).

The requirements are as follows.

- A compatible source (input) location that contains your data for Unstructured to process. [See the list of supported source types](/ui/connectors#sources).

  If your source (input) location is not in this list, or if you do not yet have any source locations for Unstructured to process, **stop here** and 
  skip over to the [Dropbox source connector quickstart](/ui/sources/dropbox-source-quickstart) instead. This quickstart 
  guides you through the process of creating a free Dropbox account, uploading your files to Dropbox, 
  and creating a source connector to connect Unstructured to those files.

- For document-based source locations, compatible files in that location. [See the list of supported file types](/ui/supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.
- A compatible destination (output) location for Unstructured to put the processed data. [See the list of supported destination types](/ui/connectors#destinations).

  If your destination (output) location is not in this list, or if you do not yet have any destination locations for Unstructured to send its processed data, **stop here** and 
  skip over to the [Pinecone destination connector quickstart](/ui/destinations/pinecone-destination-quickstart) instead. This quickstart 
  guides you through the process of creating a free Pinecone account 
  and creating a destination connector to connect Unstructured to a Pinecone dense serverless index within your Pinecone account.

        2. Click **Sources**.
        3. Click **New** or **Create Connector**.
        4. For **Name**, enter some unique name for this connector.
        5. In the **Provider** area, click the source location type that matches yours.
        6. Click **Continue**.
        7. Fill in the fields with the appropriate settings. [Learn more](/ui/sources/overview).
        8. If a **Continue** button appears, click it, and fill in any additional settings fields.
        9. Click **Save and Test**. 
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set the destination (output) location">
        ![Destinations in the sidebar](/img/ui/Destinations-Sidebar.png)
        1. In the sidebar, click **Connectors**.
        2. Click **Destinations**.
        3. Click **New** or **Create Connector**.
        4. For **Name**, enter some unique name for this connector.
        5. In the **Provider** area, click the destination location type that matches yours.
        6. Click **Continue**.
        7. Fill in the fields with the appropriate settings. [Learn more](/ui/sources/overview).
        8. If a **Continue** button appears, click it, and fill in any additional settings fields.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Define the workflow">
        ![Workflows in the sidebar](/img/ui/Workflows-Sidebar.png)
        1. In the sidebar, click **Workflows**.
        2. Click **New Workflow**.
        3. Next to **Build it for Me**, click **Create Workflow**.

           <Note>If a radio button appears instead of **Build it for Me**, select it, and then click **Continue**.</Note>

        4. For **Workflow Name**, enter some unique name for this workflow.
        5. In the **Sources** dropdown list, select your source location from Step 3.
        6. In the **Destinations** dropdown list, select your destination location from Step 4.

           <Note>You can select multiple source and destination locations. Files will be ingested from all of the selected source locations, and the processed data will be delivered to all of the selected destination locations.</Note>

        7. Click **Continue**.
        8. The **Reprocess All** box applies only to blob storage connectors such as the Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage connectors:

           - Checking this box reprocesses all documents in the source location on every workflow run.
           - Unchecking this box causes only new documents that are added to the source location, or existing documents that are updated in the source location (as determined by checking whether the file's version has changed), since the last workflow run to be processed on future runs. Previously processed documents are not processed again. However:

             - Even if this box is unchecked, a renamed file is always treated as a new file, regardless of whether the file's original contents have changed.
             - Even if this box is unchecked, a file that is removed but is added back later with the same file name is processed on future runs only if the file's contents have changed since the file was originally processed.

        9. Click **Continue**.
        10. If you want this workflow to run on a schedule, in the **Repeat Run** dropdown list, select one of the scheduling options, and fill in the scheduling settings. Otherwise, select **Don't repeat**.
        11. Click **Complete**.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Process the documents">
        ![Workflows in the sidebar](/img/ui/Workflows-Sidebar.png)
        1. If you did not choose to run this workflow on a schedule in Step 5, you can run the workflow now: on the sidebar, click **Workflows**.
        2. Next to your workflow from Step 5, click **Run**.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Monitor the processing job">
        ![Select a job](/img/ui/Select-Job.png)
        ![Completed job](/img/ui/Job-Complete.png)
        1. In the sidebar, click **Jobs**.
        2. In the list of jobs, wait for the job's **Status** to change to **Finished**.
        3. Click the row for the job.
        4. After **Overview** displays **Finished**, go to the next Step.
