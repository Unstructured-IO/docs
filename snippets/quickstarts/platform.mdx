This quickstart uses a no-code, point-and-click user interface in your web browser to get all of your data RAG-ready. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

You will need:

- A compatible source (input) location in cloud storage that contains your documents for Unstructured to process. [See the list of supported source types](/platform/connectors#sources).
- Compatible files in your source location. [See the list of supported file types](/platform/supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.
- A compatible destination (output) location in cloud storage for Unstructured to put the processed data. [See the list of supported destination types](/platform/connectors#destinations).
