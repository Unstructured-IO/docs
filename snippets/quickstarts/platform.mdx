This quickstart uses a no-code, point-and-click user interface in your web browser to get all of your data RAG-ready. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

The requirements are as follows.

- A compatible source (input) location in cloud storage that contains your documents for Unstructured to process. [See the list of supported source types](/platform/connectors#sources).
- Compatible files in your source location. [See the list of supported file types](/platform/supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.
- A compatible destination (output) location in cloud storage for Unstructured to put the processed data. [See the list of supported destination types](/platform/connectors#destinations).

        1. In the sidebar, click **Workflows**.
        2. Click **New Workflow**.
        3. Next to **Build it with me**, click **Create Workflow**.

           <Note>If a radio button appears instead of **Build it with me**, select it, and then click **Continue**.</Note>

        4. For **Workflow Name**, enter some unique name for this workflow.
        5. In the **Sources** dropdown list, select your source location from Step 3.
        6. In the **Destinations** dropdown list, select your destination location from Step 4.

           <Note>You can select multiple source and destination locations. Files will be ingested from all of the selected source locations, and the processed data will be delivered to all of the selected destination locations.</Note>

        7. Click **Continue**.
        8. In the **Optimize for** section, select the option to choose one of these predefined workflow settings groups:

            - **Basic**: Ideal for simple, text-only documents.
            - **Advanced**: Best for PDFs, images, and complex file types.
            - **Platinum**: For your most challenging documents, including scanned and handwritten content. It uses vision language models (VLMs). 
              During processing, files that are not PDFs or images are processed by using the **Advanced** strategy and are charged at the **Advanced** rate instead.

        9. The **Reprocess all** box applies only to the Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage source connectors:

           - Checking this box reprocesses all documents in the source location on every workflow run.
           - Unchecking this box causes only new documents that are added to the source location since the last workflow run to be processed on future runs. Previously processed documents are not processed again, even if those documents' contents change.

        10. If you want to retry processing any documents that failed to process, check the **Retry Failed Documents** box.
        11. Click **Continue**.
        12. If you want this workflow to run on a schedule, in the **Repeat Run** dropdown list, select one of the scheduling options, and fill in the scheduling settings. Otherwise, select **Don't repeat**.
        13. Click **Complete**.
