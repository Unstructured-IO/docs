This quickstart uses a no-code, point-and-click user interface (UI) in your web browser to have Unstructured process a single file that is stored on your local machine. 

The file is first processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources. The UI then shows the processed data that Unstructured generates for that file. 
You can download that processed data as a `.json` file to your local machine.

This approach enables rapid, local, run-adjust-repeat prototyping of end-to-end Unstructured ETL+ workflows with a full range of Unstructured features. 
After you get the results you want, you can then attach remote source and destination connectors to both ends of your existing workflow to begin processing remote files and data at scale in production.

To run this quickstart, you will need a local file with a size of 20 MB or less for video and audio files, and 10 MB or less for 
all other file types. This quickstart supports the following file types:

| | | | | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.3gp` | `.aac` | `.avi` | `.bmp` | `.csv` | `.doc` | `.docx` | `.email` | `.epub` |
| `.flac` | `.flv` | `.heic` | `.html` | `.jpg` | `.m4a` | `.md` | `.mov` | `.mp2` |
| `.mp3` | `.mp4` | `.mpeg` | `.mpegs` | `.mpg` | `.mpgs` | `.odt` | `.ogg` | `.opus` |
| `.org` | `.pcm` | `.pdf` | `.pot` | `.potm` |  `.ppt` | `.pptm` | `.pptx` | `.rst` |
| `.rtf` | `.sgl` | `.tiff` | `.txt` | `.tsv` | `.wav` | `.webm` | `.wmv` | `.xls` |
| `.xlsx` | `.xml` |

<Note>
    Video and audio file processing is available only for [self-hosted](/self-hosted/overview) deployments of Unstructured.

    For processing remote files at scale in production, Unstructured supports many more files types than these. [See the list of supported file types](/ui/supported-file-types).

    Unstructured also supports processing files from remote object stores, and data from remote sources in websites, web apps, databases, and vector stores. For more information, see the [source connector overview](/ui/sources/overview) and the [remote quickstart](/ui/quickstart#remote-quickstart) 
    for how to set up and run production-ready Unstructured ETL+ workflows at scale.
</Note>

If you do not have any files available, you can use one of the sample files that Unstructured offers in the UI. Or, you can download one or more sample files 
from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

    <Step title="Sign up and sign in">
        <GetStartedSimpleUIOnly />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a workflow">
        1. In the Unstructured UI, on the sidebar, click **Workflows**.

           ![Workflows in the sidebar](/img/ui/Workflows-Sidebar.png)

        2. Click **New Workflow**.
        3. Select **Build it Myself**, if it is not already selected.
        4. Click **Continue**. The visual workflow editor appears. 

           ![Visual workflow designer](/img/ui/Workflow-Single-File-Design.png)
           
           The workflow is represented visually as a series of directed acyclic graph (DAG) nodes. Each node represents a 
           step in the workflow. The workflow proceeds end to end from left to right. By default, the workflow starts with three nodes:

           - **Source**: This node represents the location where you have your files or data for Unstructured to process. For this quickstart, this node represents a single file on your local machine. 
             After you get the results you want, you can update this node to represent files or data in a remote location at scale in production.
           - **Partitioner**: This node represents the [partitioning](/ui/partitioning) step, which extracts content from unstructured files and data and outputs it as structured 
             [document elements](/ui/document-elements) for consistent representation across varying kinds of file and data types. For this quickstart, this node extracts the contents of a single file on 
             your local machine and outputs it as a series of structured document elements in JSON format.
           - **Destination**: This node represents the location where you want Unstructured to put the processed files or data. 
             After you get the results you want, you can update this node to have Unstructured put the processed files or data into a remote location at scale in production.
    
    </Step>
    <Step title="Process a local file">
        1. Drag the file that you want Unstructured to process from your local machine's file browser app and drop it into the **Source** node's **Drop file to test** area. 
           The file must have a size of 20 MB or less for video and audio files, and 10 MB or less for all other file types. 
           The file must be one of the supported file types listed at the beginning of this quickstart.

           If you are not able to drag and drop the file, you can click **Drop file to test** and then browse to and select the file instead.

           Alternatively, you can use a sample file that Unstructured offers. To do this, click the **Source** node, and then in the **Source** pane, with 
           **Details** selected, on the **Local file** tab, click one of the files under **Or use a provided sample file**. To view the file's contents before you 
           select it, click the eyes button next to the file.

        2. If you are using a video or audio file, you must use a multimedia paritioning strategy; otherwise, you might get an error during processing. 
           To select the multimedia partitioning strategy, click the **Partitioner** node, and then click **Auto** or **Multimedia**.

           <Note>
               Video and audio file processing is available only for [self-hosted](/self-hosted/overview) deployments of Unstructured.
           </Note>

        3. Above the **Source** node, click **Test**.

           ![Testing a single local file workflow](/img/ui/Workflow-Test-Source.png)

           Unstructured displays a visual representation of the file and begins processing its contents, sending it through each of the workflow's nodes in sequence. 
           Depending on the file's size and the workflow's complexity, this processing could take several minutes. 

           After Unstructured has finished its processing, the processed data appears in the **Test output** pane, as a series of structured elements in JSON format. 
           
           ![Viewing single local file output](/img/ui/Workflow-Test-Single-File-Output.png)

        4. In the **Test output** pane, you can:
        
           - Search through the processed, JSON-formatted representation of the file by using the **Search JSON** box.
           - Download the full JSON as a `.json` file to your local machine by clicking **Download full JSON**.

        5. When you are done, click the **Close** button in the **Test output** pane.

    </Step> 
    <Step title="Add more nodes to the workflow">
        1. You can now add more nodes to the workflow to do further testing of various Unstructured features and with the option of eventually moving the workflow into production. For example, you can:
        
           ![Adding a node to the workflow](/img/ui/Workflow-Add-Node.png)

           - Add a **Chunker** node after the **Partitioner** node, to chunk the partitioned data into smaller pieces for your retrieval augmented generation (RAG) applications. 
             To do this, click the add (**+**) button to the right of the **Partitioner** node, and then click **Enrich > Chunker**. Click the new **Chunker** node and 
             specify its settings. For help, click the **FAQ** button in the **Chunker** node's pane. [Learn more about chunking and chunker settings](/ui/chunking).
           - Add an **Enrichment** node after the **Chunker** node, to apply enrichments to the chunked data such as image summaries, table summaries, table-to-HTML transforms, and 
             named entity recognition (NER). To do this, click the add (**+**) button to the right of the **Chunker** node, and then click **Enrich > Enrichment**. 
             Click the new **Enrichment** node and specify its settings. For help, click the **FAQ** button in the **Enrichment** node's pane. [Learn more about enrichments and enrichment settings](/ui/enriching/overview).
           - Add an **Embedder** node after the **Enrichment** node, to generate vector embeddings for performing vector-based searches. To do this, click the add (**+**) button to the 
             right of the **Enrichment** node, and then click **Transform > Embedder**. Click the new **Embedder** node and specify its settings. For help, click the **FAQ** button 
             in the **Embedder** node's pane. [Learn more about embedding and embedding settings](/ui/embedding).
    
        2. Each time you add a node or change its settings, you can click **Test** above the **Source** node again to test the current workflow end to end and see the results of the changes, if any.

        3. Keep repeating this step as many times as you want, until you get the results you want.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Next steps">
        After you get the results you want, you have the option of moving your workflow into production. To do this, complete the following instructions.

        <Note>
            The following instructions have you create a new workflow that is suitable for production. 
            This behavior is planned to be fixed in a future release, allowing you to update the workflow that you just created, rather than needing to create a new one.
        </Note>
        
        1. With your workflow remaining open in the visual workflow editor, open a new tab in your web browser, and in this new tab, 
           sign in to your Unstructured account, at [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io).
        2. In this new tab, create a [source connector](/ui/sources/overview) for your remote source location. This is the location in production where you have files or data in a file or object store, website, database, or vector store that you want Unstructured to process.

           ![Connectors button on the sidebar](/img/ui/Sources-Sidebar.png)

        3. Create a [destination connector](/ui/destinations/overview) for your remote destination location. This is the location in production where you want Unstructured to put the processed data as `.json` files in a file or object store, or as records in a database or vector store.
        4. Create a workflow: on the sidebar, click **Workflows**, and then click **New Workflow**. Select **Build it Myself**, and then click **Continue** to open the visual workflow editor. 
        5. In the visual workflow editor, click **Source**.
        6. In the **Source** pane, with **Details** selected, on the **Connectors** tab, select the source connector that you just created.
        7. Click the **Destination** node.
        8. In the **Destination** pane, with **Details** selected, select the destination connector that you just created.
        9. Using your original workflow on the other tab as a guide, add any additional nodes to this new workflow as needed, and configure those new nodes' settings to match the other ones. 
        10. Click **Save**.
        11. To run the workflow:
        
            a. Make sure to click **Save** first.<br/>
            b. Click the **Close** button next to the workflow's name in the top navigation bar.<br/>
            c. On the sidebar, click **Workflows**.<br/>
            d. In the list of available workflows, click the **Run** button for the workflow that you just saved.<br/>
            e. On the sidebar, click **Jobs**.<br/>

               ![Viewing the list of available jobs](/img/ui/Select-Job.png)

            f. In the list of available jobs, click the job that you just ran.<br/>
            g. After the job status shows **Finished**, go to the your destination location to see the processed files or data that Unstructured put there.
