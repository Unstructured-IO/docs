This walkthrough uses the Unstructured Python SDK to provide you with deep, hands-on experience with Unstructured end-to-end. 
As you follow along, you will learn how to use many of the Unstructured API's workflow operations' features for partitioning, enriching, chunking, and embedding. 
The Python code for this walkthough is in a remote hosted Google Colab notebook. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources. This notebook requires no local setup.

To run this walkthrough, open the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Unstructured-IO/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/Unstructured_API_Walkthrough.ipynb) and begin following the notebook's on-screen instructions.

<Note>
    This walkthrough focuses on remote file processing and requires you to set up connectors to source and 
    destination locations for demonstration purposes. 
    
    To use the Unstructured Python SDK with local files only, try the [quickstart](/api-reference/workflow/overview#quickstart) instead.
