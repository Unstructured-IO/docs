This walkthrough uses the Unstructured Python SDK to provide you with deep, hands-on experience with Unstructured end-to-end. 
As you follow along, you will learn how to use many of the Unstructured Workflow Endpoint's features for partitioning, enriching, chunking, and embedding. 
The Python code for this walkthough is in a remote hosted Google Colab notebook. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

To run this walkthrough, open the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Unstructured-IO/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/Unstructured_API_Walkthrough.ipynb) and begin following the notebook's on-screen instructions.
