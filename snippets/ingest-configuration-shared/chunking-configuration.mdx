A common chunking configuration is a critical element in the data processing pipeline, particularly when creating embeddings and populating vector databases with the results. This configuration defines the parameters governing the segmentation of text into meaningful chunks, whether at the document, paragraph, or sentence level. It plays a pivotal role in determining the size and structure of these chunks, ensuring that they align with the specific requirements of downstream tasks, such as embedding generation and vector database population. By carefully configuring chunking parameters, users can optimize the granularity of data segments, ultimately contributing to more cohesive and contextually rich results. This is crucial for tasks like natural language processing and text analysis, as well as for the efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings in vector databases, enhancing the quality and relevance of the results.

## Configs

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`chunk_api_key`

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`chunk_by_api`: Default: `False`.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`chunk_combine_text_under_n_chars`: Combine consecutive chunks when the first does not exceed length `n` and the second will fit without exceeding the hard-maximum length. Only operative for the `by_title` chunking strategy.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`chunk_elements`: <Icon icon="ban"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;**Deprecated!** `False` (default) to not run chunking as part of the ingest process. This option is deprecated in favor of the `chunking_strategy` option. Setting this to `True` has the same effect as `chunking_strategy=by_title`.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`chunk_include_orig_elements`: `True` when chunking to add the original elements consolidated to form each chunk to `.metadata.orig_elements` on that chunk.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`chunk_max_characters`: Default: `500`. The hard-maximum chunk length. No chunk will exceed this length. An oversized element will be divided by text-splitting to fit this window.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`chunk_multipage_selections`: `True` to ignore page boundaries when chunking such that elements from two different pages can appear in the same chunk. Only operative for the `by_title` chunking strategy.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`chunk_new_after_n_chars`: The soft-maximum chunk length. Another element will not be added to a chunk of `n` length even when it would fit without exceeding the hard-maximum length.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`chunk_overlap`: Default: `0`. Prefix each chunk's text with the last overlap of `n` characters from the prior chunk. Only applies to oversized chunks divided by text-splitting. To apply overlap to non-oversized chunks, use `chunk_overlap_all`.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`chunk_overlap_all`: Applies overlap to chunks formed from whole elements as well as those formed by text-splitting oversized elements. The overlap length is taken from the `chunk_overlap` value.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`chunking_endpoint`

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>&nbsp;,<Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`chunking_strategy`: One of `basic` or `by_title`. When omitted, no chunking is performed. The `basic` strategy maximally fills each chunk with whole elements, up the specified size limits as specified by `max_characters` and `new_after_n_chars`. A single element that exceeds this length is divided into two or more chunks using text-splitting. A `Table` element is never combined with any other element and appears as a chunk of its own or as a sequence of `TableChunk` elements splitting is required. The `by_title` behaviors are the same except that section and optionally page boundaries are respected such that two consecutive elements from different sections appear in separate chunks.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`combine_text_under_n_chars`: Default: `max_characters`. Combines small elements (for example a series of `Title` elements) until a section reaches a length of `n `characters. Only operative for the `by_title` chunking strategy. Defaults to max\_characters which combines chunks whenever space allows. Specifying `0` for this argument suppresses combining of small chunks.
    
*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`include_orig_elements`: Default: `True`. Adds the document elements consolidated to form each chunk to the `orig_elements` field in `metadata`. Setting this to `False` allows for somewhat smaller payloads when you don't need that metadata.
    
*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`max_characters`: Default: `500`. Combine elements into chunks no larger than `n` characters. This is a hard maximum: no chunk with text longer than this value will appear in the output stream.
    
*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`multipage_sections`: Default: `True`. When `False`, in addition to section boundaries, page boundaries are also respected. Only operative for the `by_title` chunking strategy.
    
*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`new_after_n_chars`: Default: `max_characters (off)`. Cuts off new chunks once they reach a length of `n` characters. This is a soft maximum. Defaults to `max_characters` when not specified, which effectively disables any soft window. Specifying `0` for this argument causes each element to appear in a chunk by itself (although an element with text longer than `max_characters` will be still be divided into two or more chunks using text splitting).

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`overlap`: Default: `0`. Prefix each chunk's text with the last overlap of `n` characters from the prior chunk. Only applies to oversized chunks divided by text-splitting. To apply overlap to non-oversized chunks, use `overlap_all`.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`overlap_all`: Applies overlap to chunks formed from whole elements as well as those formed by text-splitting oversized elements. The overlap length is taken from the `overlap` value.
