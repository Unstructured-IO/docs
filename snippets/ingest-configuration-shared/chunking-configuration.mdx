A common chunking configuration is a critical element in the data processing pipeline, particularly when creating embeddings and populating vector databases with the results. This configuration defines the parameters governing the segmentation of text into meaningful chunks, whether at the document, paragraph, or sentence level. It plays a pivotal role in determining the size and structure of these chunks, ensuring that they align with the specific requirements of downstream tasks, such as embedding generation and vector database population. By carefully configuring chunking parameters, users can optimize the granularity of data segments, ultimately contributing to more cohesive and contextually rich results. This is crucial for tasks like natural language processing and text analysis, as well as for the efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings in vector databases, enhancing the quality and relevance of the results.

## Configs

*   `chunk_api_key`: If `chunk_by_api` is set to `True`, requests that are sent to the Unstructured API will use this Unstructured API key to make authenticated calls.

*   `chunk_by_api`: Default: `False`. If set to `True`, uses Unstructured to run chunking. If set to `False`, runs chunking locally.

*   `chunk_combine_text_under_n_chars`: Combine consecutive chunks when the first does not exceed length `n` and the second will fit without exceeding the hard-maximum length. Only operative for the `by_title` chunking strategy.

*   `chunk_include_orig_elements`: `True` when chunking to add the original elements consolidated to form each chunk to `.metadata.orig_elements` on that chunk.

*   `chunk_max_characters`: Default: `500`. The hard-maximum chunk length. No chunk will exceed this length. An oversized element will be divided by text-splitting to fit this window.

*   `chunk_multipage_selections`: `True` to ignore page boundaries when chunking such that elements from two different pages can appear in the same chunk. Only operative for the `by_title` chunking strategy.

*   `chunk_new_after_n_chars`: The soft-maximum chunk length. Another element will not be added to a chunk of `n` length even when it would fit without exceeding the hard-maximum length.

*   `chunk_overlap`: Default: `0`. Prefix each chunk's text with the last overlap of `n` characters from the prior chunk. Only applies to oversized chunks divided by text-splitting. To apply overlap to non-oversized chunks, use `chunk_overlap_all`.

*   `chunk_overlap_all`: Applies overlap to chunks formed from whole elements as well as those formed by text-splitting oversized elements. The overlap length is taken from the `chunk_overlap` value.

*   `chunking_endpoint`: If `chunk_by_api` is set to `True`, chunking requests are sent to this Unstructured API URL. By default, this URL is the legacy Unstructured Partition Endpoint URL: `https://api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general`. However, you should always use the URL that was provided to you when your Unstructured account was created. If you do not have this URL, email Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).

*   `chunking_strategy`: One of `basic` or `by_title`. When omitted, no chunking is performed. The `basic` strategy maximally fills each chunk with whole elements, up the specified size limits as specified by `max_characters` and `new_after_n_chars`. A single element that exceeds this length is divided into two or more chunks using text-splitting. A `Table` element is never combined with any other element and appears as a chunk of its own or as a sequence of `TableChunk` elements splitting is required. The `by_title` behaviors are the same except that section and optionally page boundaries are respected such that two consecutive elements from different sections appear in separate chunks.
