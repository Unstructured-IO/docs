A common fsspec configuration is a shared set of parameters and settings utilized by connectors responsible for managing cloud-based file-system content. These configurations enable connectors to interact with cloud storage systems consistently, specifying details such as authentication credentials, access permissions, storage locations, and optimization options. By standardizing these fsspec configurations, connectors can seamlessly interface with various cloud-based file systems, promoting interoperability and efficient management of remote data storage across different cloud providers.

## File Storage Configuration

Fsspec configuration is an extension of the File Storage Config: 

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`recursive`: Default: `False`. If a directory path is provided, whether further folders should be traversed recursively.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`remote_url`: Path to the content on the remote system, prefixed with the protocol (for example, `s3://...`).

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`uncompress`: Default: `False`. Whether to uncompress tar and zip files when downloaded. Will ignore these otherwise.

## Configs

The following are configurations set on the fsspec config itself:

*

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`access_config`: A dictionary of access keyword arguments (`kwargs`) that might be needed to provide access to the cloud provider associated with the data.

The following are generated for the user after the config is initialized: 

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`dir_path` and `file_path`: The raw remote path is parsed into the directory and file if it exists.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`path_without_protocol`: The file path on the remote source without the protocol.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`protocol`: The protocol is extracted from the raw remote path passed in (for example, `s3` from `s3://...`).
