A common process configuration plays a pivotal role in overseeing the entire ingest process, encompassing various aspects to ensure efficiency and reliability. This configuration includes parameters for managing a pool of workers, which allows for parallelization of the ingest process to maximize throughput. Additionally, it addresses the storage and retrieval of intermediate results, supporting caching strategies that enable replayability in case of errors or interruptions. By configuring worker pools, the process can efficiently handle multiple tasks concurrently, enhancing performance. Furthermore, saving intermediate results allows for the resumption of the process from a known state, reducing data loss and ensuring robustness in the face of unexpected errors or system failures. This comprehensive configuration promotes an organized and resilient approach to data ingestion, improving overall system reliability and efficiency.

## Configs

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`disable_parallelism`: `True` if the `INGEST_DISABLE_PARALLELISM` environment variable is set to `true` (case-insensitive), otherwise `False` (the default).

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`download_only`: Default: `False`. If set to `True`, downloads any files that are not already present in the connector's specified download directory (`download_dir`), or `work_dir` if `download_dir` is not specified, or the default file path for `work_dir` if `work_dir` is not specified.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`max_connections`: The maximum of connections allowed when running an asynchronous step in the ingest pipeline.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`max_docs`: The maximum number of documents to process.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>,&nbsp;<Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`num_processes`: Default: `2`. For every step that can use a pool of workers to increase throughput, how many workers to configure in the pool.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`output_dir`: Where the final results will be located when the process is finished. This is regardless of whether a destination is configured. If a directory is not specified, by default a folder named `structured-output`, relative to the current working directory, is used.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`preserve_downloads`: `False` (the default) to remove downloaded files after they are successfully processed.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>,&nbsp;<Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`raise_on_error`: `False `(default) for any single document that fails in the process, causes the error to be logged but allows for all other documents to proceed in the process. If `True`, causes the entire process to fail and raise the error if any one document fails.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`re_download`: `False` (the default) to not re-download files if they are already present in the download directory.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>,&nbsp;<Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`reprocess`: Default: `False`. If set to `True`, will ignore all content that may have been cached and rerun each step.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`tqdm`: `False` (the default) to not show a progress bar.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`uncompress`: `False` (the default) to not uncompress any archived ZIP or TAR files.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>,&nbsp;<Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`verbose`: Default: `False`. If set to `True`, debug logging should be included in the output.

*   <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>,&nbsp;<Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`work_dir`: The file path for where intermediate results should be saved. If a file path is not set, a default file path will be used relative to the user's home directory (`/home/username/.cache/unstructured/ingest/pipeline` or `C:\Users\username\.cache\unstructured\ingest\pipeline`).
