The configurations listed in this section are common to all connectors.
These configurations act as instructions for how to collect, process, and store data.

Some connectors implement only version 2 (v2) of the connector specification; some connectors implement only version 1 (v1); and some connectors provide both v2 and v1 implementations.

*   Connectors that implement both v2 and v1 are prefaced by <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>, <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>.

*   v2-only implementations are prefaced by <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>.

*   v1-only implementations are prefaced by <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>.

If you're looking for parameters specific to a connector (such as authentication options)&mdash;or to determine whether a connector provides a v2 implementation, a v1 implementation, or both&mdash;browse the
corresponding connector's source code:
