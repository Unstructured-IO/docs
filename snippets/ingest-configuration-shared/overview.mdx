The configurations listed in this section are common to all source connectors.
These configurations act as instructions for how to collect, process, and store data.
If you're looking for parameters specific to a source connector type (such as authentication options), see the
corresponding source connector's documentation.

Configurations are available for v2 and v1 versions of source connctors, where available. 

*   Congigurations that apply to both v2 and v1 are prefaced by <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>, <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>.

*   v2-only configurations are prefaced by <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="2"/>.

*   v1-only configurations are prefaced by <Icon icon="v"/><Icon icon="1"/>.

If you're looking for parameters specific to a source connector type (such as authentication options)&mdash;or to determine whether a source connector supports v2 configurations, v1 configurations, or both&mdash;see the
