Connect GitLab to your preprocessing pipeline, and batch process all your documents using `unstructured-ingest` to store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.

First, install the GitLab dependencies as shown here.

```bash
pip install "unstructured[gitlab]"
```

Provide the GitLab repo URL (`url`) to fetch the files from, e.g. `"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/content-sites/docsy-gitlab"`,
and supply your GitLab access token (`git-access-token`).
Learn more about GitLab authentication [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/rest/index.html#personalprojectgroup-access-tokens).

Optionally, specify a branch and what file types to limit the ingestion to:
* `git-branch`: The branch to fetch files from. If not given, the default repository branch is used.
* `git-file-glob`: A comma-separated list of file globs to limit which types of files are accepted, e.g. `'*.html,*.txt'`
