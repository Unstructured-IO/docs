Connect S3 to your preprocessing pipeline, and batch process all your documents using `unstructured-ingest` to store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.

First, install the S3 dependencies as shown here.

```bash
pip install "unstructured[s3]"
```

Use the `remote-url` parameter to provide the remote URL formatted as `protocol://dir/path`.
If your S3 bucket allows access without local AWS credentials, you can set the `anonymous` flag.

If your S3 bucket doesn't allow anonymous access, make sure to provide your credentials:
* `key`: access key ID. Takes precedence over.
* `secret`: secret access key.
* `token`: security token.
