Connect Delta Table to your preprocessing pipeline, and batch process all your documents using `unstructured-ingest` to
store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.

Make sure to have the Delta Table dependencies installed:

    ```bash Shell
    pip install "unstructured-ingest[delta-table]"
    ```

AWS credentials need to be available for use with the storage options.
Specify the to the DeltaTable using the `table-uri` argument, and pass a dictionary of the options to use for the storage backend
via `storage_options`.
