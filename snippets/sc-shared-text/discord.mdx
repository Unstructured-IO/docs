Connect Discord to your preprocessing pipeline, and batch process all your documents using `unstructured-ingest` to
store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.

Make sure to have the Discord dependencies installed:

    ```bash Shell
    pip install "unstructured-ingest[discord]"
    ```

To ingests the contents of Discord channels, you need to supply the following information:
* `token`: an authentication token used to access Discord API
* `channels`: a list of discord channel ids to ingest from

Optionally you can set the number of days to go back in history of the channels via the `period` argument.
