Connect Wikipedia to your preprocessing pipeline, and batch process all your documents using `unstructured-ingest` to store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.

First, install the Wikipedia dependencies as shown here.

```bash
pip install "unstructured-ingest[wikipedia]"
```

Provide the `page-title` to ingest the text from.
