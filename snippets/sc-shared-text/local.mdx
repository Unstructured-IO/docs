Connect local files to your preprocessing pipeline, and batch process all your documents
using `unstructured-ingest` to store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.


To use the Local source connector, you have to specify the `input-path`: path in the local file system which contains
documents you wish to process.
Optionally you can limit processing to certain file types via `file-glob` parameter, e.g. `--file-glob .docx`
ensures only .docx files are processed.
