Connect local files to your preprocessing pipeline, and use the Unstructured Ingest CLI or the Unstructured Ingest Python library to batch process all your documents and store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.

You will need the local source connector dependencies:

```bash CLI, Python
pip install unstructured-ingest
```

To use the local source connector, you must set `--input-path` (CLI) or `input_path` (Python) to the path in the local filesystem which contains
documents you wish to process. Optionally, you can limit processing to certain file types by setting `--file-glob` (CLI) or `file_glob` (Python), for example to `.docx`
to process only `.docx` files.
