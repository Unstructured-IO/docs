Connect Box to your preprocessing pipeline, and use the Unstructured CLI or Python to batch process all your documents and store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.

You will need: 

import SharedBox from '/snippets/general-shared-text/box.mdx';
import SharedBoxCLIAPI from '/snippets/general-shared-text/box-cli-api.mdx';

<SharedBox />
<SharedBoxCLIAPI />
