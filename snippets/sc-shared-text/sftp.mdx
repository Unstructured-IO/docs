Connect SFTP to your preprocessing pipeline, and batch process all your documents using `unstructured-ingest` to store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.
For downloading an individual file specifically, the filename must have an extension. Otherwise it will be treated as a directory.

First, install the SFTP dependencies as shown below .

```bash
pip install "unstructured[sftp]"
```

To connect to your SFTP storage, provide its `remote-url`, and authenticate yourself with `username` and `password`.
