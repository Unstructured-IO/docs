Connect Google Drive to your preprocessing pipeline, and batch process all your documents using `unstructured-ingest` to store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.

First, install the Google Drive dependencies as shown here.

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash Version 2
    pip install "unstructured[google-drive]"
    ```
    ```bash Version 1
    pip install "unstructured[gdrive]"
    ```

</CodeGroup>

Make sure to set up a service account and get a service account key - [learn how](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#service-account).
Make sure the email address for the service account is given access to the Google Drive folder.
For `--drive-id` (CLI) or `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` (SDK), specify the folder ID: this is a part of the URL for your Google Drive folder represented in the following URL as `{folder_id}`: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/{folder-id}`.
