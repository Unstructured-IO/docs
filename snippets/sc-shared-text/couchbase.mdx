Batch process all your records using `unstructured-ingest` to store structured outputs locally on your filesystem and upload those local files to a Couchbase collection.

First, install the Couchbase dependencies as shown here.

```bash
pip install "unstructured[couchbase]"
```

Specify the following parameters to configure your Couchbase source connector:
* `connection-string`: connection string of the database
* `username`: Username to authenticate into the database
* `password`: Password to authenticate into the database
* `bucket`: Name of the Couchbase bucket to pull data from
* `scope`: Name of the Couchbase scope to pull data from
* `collection`: Name of the Couchbase collection to pull data from
* `batch-size`: How many documents to read at a time per process
