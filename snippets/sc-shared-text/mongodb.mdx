Batch process all your records using `unstructured-ingest` to store structured outputs locally on your filesystem and upload those local files to an MongoDB collection.

First, install the MongoDB dependencies as shown here:

```bash
pip install "unstructured[mongodb]"
```

Specify the following parameters to configure your MongoDB source connector:

* `uri`: URI to user when connecting.
* `host`: Hostname, IP address, or Unix domain socket path where mongodb database is served.
* `port`: Port where mongodb database is served.
* `database`: Database name to connect to.
* `collection`: Collection name to ingest data from.
* `batch-size`: How many records to read at a time per process.
