Connect OneDrive to your preprocessing pipeline, and batch process all your documents using `unstructured-ingest` to
store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.

First, install the Airtable dependencies as shown here.

```bash
pip install "unstructured[onedrive]"
```

When connecting to OneDrive, make sure to have your credentials ready:
* `client-id`: Azure AD app client id.
* `client-cred`: Azure AD app client secret.
* `user-pname`: User principal name, usually is your Azure AD email.

Optionally, you can specify:
* `authority-url`: Authentication token provider for Microsoft apps, default is `https://login.microsoftonline.com`
* `tenant`:  ID or domain name associated with your Azure AD instance, default is `common`
* `path`: Folder to start parsing files from.
