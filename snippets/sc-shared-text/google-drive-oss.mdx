Connect Google Drive to your preprocessing pipeline, and use the Unstructured CLI or Python SDK to batch process all your documents and store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.

You will need:

- The Google Drive connector dependencies:

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash CLI, Python SDK
    pip install "unstructured[google-drive]"
    ```

</CodeGroup>

- A Google Cloud service account and its related `credentials.json` key file or its contents in JSON format. [Learn how](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#service-account).
- Give the service account's email address access to the Google Drive folder.
- These environment variables:

  - `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` - The folder ID. This is a part of the URL for your Google Drive folder represented in the following URL as `{folder_id}`: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/{folder-id}`.
  - `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` - The path to the `credentials.json` key file or its contents in JSON format.
