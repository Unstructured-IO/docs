Connect Elasticsearch to your preprocessing pipeline, and use the Unstructured Ingest CLI or the Unstructured Ingest Python library to batch process all your documents and store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.

You will need: 

import SharedElasticsearch from '/snippets/general-shared-text/elasticsearch.mdx';
import SharedElasticsearchCLIAPI from '/snippets/general-shared-text/elasticsearch-cli-api.mdx';

<SharedElasticsearch />
<SharedElasticsearchCLIAPI />
