Connect Azure Blob storage to your preprocessing pipeline, and batch process all your documents using `unstructured-ingest` to
store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.


Make sure to have the Azure dependencies installed:

    ```bash Shell
    pip install "unstructured[azure]"
    ```

Depending on how you have configured your Azure Blob storage, you may need to authenticate yourself to access the data.

The following authentication parameters are supported:
* `account_name`
* `account_key`
* `connection_string`
* `sas_token`
