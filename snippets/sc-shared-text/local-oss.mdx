Connect local files to your preprocessing pipeline, and use the Unstructured CLI or Python SDK to batch process all your documents and store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.

You will need the local source connector dependencies:

```bash CLI, Python SDK
pip install unstructured
```

To use the local source connector, you must set `--input-path` (CLI) or `input_path` (Python SDK) to the path in the local filesystem which contains
documents you wish to process. Optionally, you can limit processing to certain file types by setting `--file-glob` (CLI) or `file_glob` (Python SDK), for example to `.docx`
to process only `.docx` files.
