Connect Biomed to your preprocessing pipeline, and batch process all your documents using `unstructured-ingest` to
store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.

This connector allows you to extract Biomedical documents from the supported FTP directories:
* https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf

Make sure to have the Biomed dependencies installed:

    ```bash Shell
    pip install "unstructured-ingest[biomed]"
    ```

You need to provide the path, from which the documents should be downloaded. For example, to download the documents in
the path: `https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/07/`, set the `path` parameter to `oa_pdf/07/`
