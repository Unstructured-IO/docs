Connect Confluence to your preprocessing pipeline, and use the Unstructured CLI or Python to batch process all your spaces and pages and store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.

The requirements are as follows. 

import SharedConfluence from '/snippets/general-shared-text/confluence.mdx';
import SharedConfluenceCLIAPI from '/snippets/general-shared-text/confluence-cli-api.mdx';

<SharedConfluence />
<SharedConfluenceCLIAPI />
