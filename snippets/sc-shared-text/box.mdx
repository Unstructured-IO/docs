Connect Box to your preprocessing pipeline, and batch process all your documents using `unstructured-ingest` to
store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.

Make sure to have the Box dependencies installed:

    ```bash Shell
    pip install "unstructured[box]"
    ```

Set up your App/Credentials to access Box folders/files (doesn't work with a free Box account):
* Make sure the App service email is a collaborator for your folder (co-owner or editor).
* Make sure you have the 'write all files' application scope.
* Check 'Make api calls as the as-user header'.
* Reauthorize the app after making any of the above changes.

Specify the `box-app-config` parameter which is the path to a json file, available in the App Settings
section of your Box App. Learn more about [Box app setup](https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/jwt/jwt-setup/)
and [the app config.json file](https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/jwt/with-sdk/)
