Connect Google Cloud Storage to your preprocessing pipeline, and batch process all your documents using `unstructured-ingest` to store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.

First, install the Google Cloud Storage dependencies as shown here.

```bash
pip install "unstructured[gcs]"
```

Provide the `url` of your remote storage. You may also need to authenticate yourself with your service account key: use `token` parameter for this.
