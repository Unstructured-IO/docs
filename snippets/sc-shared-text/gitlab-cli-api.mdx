Connect GitLab to your preprocessing pipeline, and use the Unstructured CLI or Python to batch process all your documents and store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.

You will need: 

import SharedGitLab from '/snippets/general-shared-text/gitlab.mdx';
import SharedGitLabCLIAPI from '/snippets/general-shared-text/gitlab-cli-api.mdx';

<SharedGitLab />
<SharedGitLabCLIAPI />
