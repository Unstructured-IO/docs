Connect Notion to your preprocessing pipeline, and batch process all your documents using `unstructured-ingest` to store
structured outputs locally on your filesystem.

First, install the Notion dependencies as shown here:

```bash
pip install "unstructured-ingest[notion]"
```

Make sure to provide `notion-api-key`. To get the credentials for your Notion workspace, follow the steps described
in [Notion documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration).

Optionally, specify the following parameters:
* `page-ids`: Notion page IDs to extract text from.
* `database-ids`: Notion database IDs to extract text from.
