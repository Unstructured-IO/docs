Connect Dropbox to your preprocessing pipeline, and batch process all your documents using `unstructured-ingest` to store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.

First, install the Dropbox dependencies as shown here.

```bash
pip install "unstructured[dropbox]"
```

If you want to ingest files and folders from the root directory use `"dropbox:// /"` in `remote-url`,
if your files and folders are in a subfolder, use `dropbox://nested-1` in `remote-url`.

To programmatically get or refresh an access token refer to [dropbox_token.py](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/blob/main/examples/ingest/dropbox/dropbox_token.py) example script.
