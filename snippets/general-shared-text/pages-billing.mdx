We calculate a page as follows:

- For these file types, a page is a page, slide, or image: .pdf, .pptx, and .tiff.
- For .docx files that have page metadata, we calculate the number of pages based on that metadata.
- For all other file types, we calculate the number of pages as the file's size divided by 100 KB.
