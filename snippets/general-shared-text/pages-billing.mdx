Unstructured calculates a page as follows:

- For these file types, a page is a page, slide, or image: `.pdf`, `.pptx`, and `.tiff`.
- For `.docx` files that have page metadata, Unstructured calculates the number of pages based on that metadata.
- For all other file types, Unstructured calculates the number of pages as the file's size divided by 100 KB.
- For non-file data, Unstructured calculates a page as 100 KB of incoming data to be processed.
