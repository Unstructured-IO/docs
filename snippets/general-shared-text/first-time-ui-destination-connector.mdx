<Note>
    If you're new to Unstructured, read this note first.
    
    Before you can create a destination connector, you must first sign in to your Unstructured account:
    
    - If you do not already have an Unstructured account, go to [https://unstructured.io/contact](https://unstructured.io/contact) and fill out the online form to indicate your interest.
    - If you already have an Unstructured account, sign in by using the URL of the sign in page that Unstructured provided to you when your Unstructured account was created.
      If you do not have this URL, contact Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).

    After you sign in, the [Unstructured user interface](/ui/overview) (UI) appears, which you use to create your destination connector.
    
    After you create the destination connector, add it along with a 
    [source connector](/ui/sources/overview) to a [workflow](/ui/workflows). Then run the worklow as a 
    [job](/ui/jobs). To learn how, try out the [hands-on UI quickstart](/ui/quickstart) or watch the 4-minute 
    [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn2FfHT6H-o).

    You can also create destination connectors with the Unstructured API. 
    [Learn how](/api-reference/workflow/destinations/overview).
    
    If you need help, reach out to the [community](https://short.unstructured.io/pzw05l7) on Slack, or

    You are now ready to start creating a destination connector! Keep reading to learn how.
