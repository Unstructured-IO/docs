<Note>
    If you're new to Unstructured, read this note first.
    
    Before you can create a destination connector, you must first sign in to your Unstructured account:
    
    - If you do not already have an Unstructured account, [sign up for free](https://unstructured.io/?modal=try-for-free). After you sign up, you are automatically signed in to your new Unstructured **Starter** account, at [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io). 
      To sign up for a **Team** or **Enterprise** account instead, [contact Unstructured Sales](https://unstructured.io/?modal=contact-sales), or [learn more](/ui/overview#how-am-i-billed%3F).
    - If you already have an Unstructured **Starter** or **Team** account and are not already signed in, sign in to your account at 
      [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io). For an **Enterprise** account, see your Unstructured account administrator for instructions, 
      or email Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).

    After you sign in, the [Unstructured user interface](/ui/overview) (UI) appears, which you use to create your destination connector.
    
    After you create the destination connector, add it along with a 
    [source connector](/ui/sources/overview) to a [workflow](/ui/workflows). Then run the worklow as a 
    [job](/ui/jobs). To learn how, try out the [hands-on UI quickstart](/ui/quickstart#remote-quickstart) or watch the 4-minute 
    [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn2FfHT6H-o).

    You can also create destination connectors with the Unstructured API. 
    [Learn how](/api-reference/workflow/destinations/overview).
    
    If you need help, email Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).

    You are now ready to start creating a destination connector! Keep reading to learn how.
