<Note>
    If you're new to Unstructured, read this note first.
    
    Before you can create this destination connector, you must first [sign up for Unstructured](https://platform.unstructured.io). 
    After you sign up, the [Unstructured user interface](/ui/overview) (UI) appears, which you use to create the destination connector.
    
    After you create the destination connector, add it along with a 
    [source connector](/ui/sources/overview) to a [workflow](/ui/workflows). Then run the worklow as a 
    [job](/ui/jobs). To learn how, try out the [hands-on UI quickstart](/ui/quickstart) or watch the 4-minute 
    [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn2FfHT6H-o).
    
    If you need help, reach out to the [community](https://short.unstructured.io/pzw05l7) on Slack, or 
    [contact us](https://unstructured.io/contact) directly.
