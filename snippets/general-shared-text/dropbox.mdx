1. A [Dropbox account](https://www.dropbox.com/try/teams).
2. A Dropbox app for your Dropbox account. To create a Dropbox app, do the following:

   a) Sign in to the [Dropbox Developers](https://www.dropbox.com/developers) portal with the same credentials as your Dropbox account.<br/>
   b) Open your [App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps).<br/>
   c) Click **Create app**.<br/>
   d) For **Choose an API**, select **Scoped access**.<br/>
   e) For **Choose the type of access you need**, select **App folder**.<br/>
   f) Enter a name for your app, and then click **Create app**.<br/>
   g) On the app's **Permissions** tab, under **Files and folders**, check the boxes labelled **files.content.read** or **files.content.write** or both, 
      depending on whether you want to read files, write files, or both. Then click **Submit**.<br/>
   h) On the app's **Settings** tab, note the value of the **App folder name** field. This is the name of the app folder that Dropbox will create under the `Apps` top-level folder in your Dropbox 
      account that the Dropbox app will use for access. If you change the value of **App folder name** field here, Dropbox will create an app folder with that name under the `Apps` top-level folder instead.<br/>
   i) Under **OAuth 2**, next to **Generated access token**, click **Generate**. Copy the value of this access token. You should only click **Generate** after you have completed all of the preceding steps first. 
      This is because the access token is scoped to the specific app folder and settings at the time the access token is generated. If you change the app folder name or any of the permissions later, 
      you should regenerate the access token.<br/>

3. The app folder that your Dropbox app will use for access can be found in your Dropbox account under the `Apps` top-level folder. For example, if the value of the **App folder name** 
   field above is `my-folder`, then the app folder that your Dropbox app will use for access can be found under `https://dropbox.com/home/Apps/my-folder`

   <Warning>
       Your Dropbox app will _not_ have access to upload or download files from the root of the app folder. Instead, you _must_ create a subfolder inside of the app folder for your Dropbox 
       app to upload or download files from. You will use the name of that subfolder when specifying your remote URL in the next step. For example, if your Dropbox app uses an app folder named `my-folder` 
       for access within the `Apps` top-level folder, and you create a subfolder named `data` within the `my-folder` app folder, then the subfolder that your Dropbox app will upload and download files from 
       can be found under `https://dropbox.com/home/Apps/my-folder/data`

   </Warning>
   
4. Note the remote URL to your subfolder inside of the app folder, which takes the format `dropbox://<subfolder-name>`. For example, 
   if your Dropbox app uses an app folder named `my-folder` for access within the `Apps` top-level folder, and you create a subfolder named `data` within the `my-folder` app folder, then 
   the remote URL is `dropbox://data`
