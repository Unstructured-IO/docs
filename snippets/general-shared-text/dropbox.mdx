- A [Dropbox account](https://www.dropbox.com/try/teams).
- A target source or destination [folder](https://help.dropbox.com/create-upload/creating-using-folders-on-dropbox) in your Dropbox account.
- A Dropbox app for your Dropbox account. To learn how to create an app, click the **App Console** tab on the [Getting Started](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/getting-started) page.
- Permission for your Dropbox app to read from, and write to, the target folder in your Dropbox account as needed. To do this:

  - On the **Permissions** tab of your Dropbox app, check the boxes **files.content.read** or **files.content.write** or both. [Learn more](https://developers.dropbox.com/oauth-guide).
  - On the **Settings** tab of your Dropbox app, for **App folder name**, set the name of the target folder in your Dropbox account for your Dropbox app to have access to.
  - Note the remote URL to the target folder, which takes the format `dropbox://<path/to/folder/in/account>`.

- An [access token](https://dropbox.tech/developers/generate-an-access-token-for-your-own-account) for your Dropbox account. Save this token in a secure location. Do not share it with others.
