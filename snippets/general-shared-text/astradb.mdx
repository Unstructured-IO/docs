- An Astra account. [Create or sign in to an Astra account](https://astra.datastax.com/).
- A database in the Astra account. [Create a database in an account](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-classic/databases/manage-create.html).
- An application token for the database. [Create a database application token](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/administration/manage-application-tokens.html).
- A namespace in the database. [Create a namespace in a database](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/databases/manage-namespaces.html#create-namespace).
- A collection in the namespace. [Create a collection in a namespace](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/databases/manage-collections.html#create-collection).

  An existing collection is not required. At runtime, the collection behavior is as follows:

  For the [Unstructured Platform](/platform/overview):

  - If an existing collection name is specified, and Unstructured generates embeddings, 
    but the number of dimensions that are generated does not match the existing collection's embedding settings, the run will fail. 
    You must change your Unstructured embedding settings or your existing collection's embedding settings to match, and try the run again.
  - If a collection name is not specified, Unstructured creates a new collection in your namespace. If Unstructured generates embeddings, 
    the new collections's name will be `u<short-workflow-id>_<short-embedding-model-name>_<number-of-dimensions>`. 
    If Unstructured does not generate embeddings, the new collections's name will be `u<short-workflow-id`.

  For [Unstructured Ingest](/ingestion/overview):

  - If an existing collection name is specified, and Unstructured generates embeddings, 
    but the number of dimensions that are generated does not match the existing collection's embedding settings, the run will fail. 
    You must change your Unstructured embedding settings or your existing collections's embedding settings to match, and try the run again. 
  - If a collection name is not specified, Unstructured creates a new collection in your Pinecone account. The new collection's name will be `unstructuredautocreated`.
