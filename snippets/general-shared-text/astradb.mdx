- An IBM Cloud account or DataStax account.

  - For an IBM Cloud account, [sign up](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) for an IBMid, and then [sign in](https://accounts.datastax.com/session-service/v1/login) to DataStax with your IBMid.
  - For a DataStax account, [sign up](https://astra.datastax.com/signup) for a DataStax account, and then [sign in](https://accounts.datastax.com/session-service/v1/login) to DataStax with your DataStax account.

- An Astra DB database in the DataStax account. To create a database:

  a. After you sign in to DataStax, click **Create database**.<br/>
  b. Click the **Serverless (vector)** tile, if it is not already selected.<br/>
  c. For **Database name**, enter some unique name for the database.<br/>
  d. Select a **Provider** and a **Region**, and then click **Create database**.<br/>
  
  [Learn more](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-classic/databases/manage-create.html).

- An application token for the database. To create an application token:

  a. After you sign in to DataStax, in the list of databases, click the name of the target database.<br/>
  b. On the **Overview** tab, under **Database Details**, in the **Application Tokens** tile, click **Generate Token**.<br/>
  c. Enter some **Token description** and select and **Expiration** time period, and then click **Generate token**.<br/>
  d. Save the application token that is displayed to a secure location, and then click **Close**.<br/>

  [Learn more](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/administration/manage-application-tokens.html).

- A keyspace in the database. To create a keyspace:

  a. After you sign in to DataStax, in the list of databases, click the name of the target database.<br/>
  b. On the **Data Explorer** tab, in the **Keyspace** list, select **Create keyspace**.<br/>
  c. Enter some **Keyspace name**, and then click **Add keyspace**.<br/>

  [Learn more](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/databases/manage-keyspaces.html#keyspaces).

- A collection in the keyspace.

  For the [Unstructured UI](/ui/overview) and [Unstructured API](/api-reference/overview):

  - An existing collection is not required. At runtime, the collection behavior is as follows:
  
    - If an existing collection name is specified, and Unstructured generates embeddings, 
      but the number of dimensions that are generated does not match the existing collection's embedding settings, the run will fail. 
      You must change your Unstructured embedding settings or your existing collection's embedding settings to match, and try the run again.
    - If a collection name is not specified, Unstructured creates a new collection in your namespace. If Unstructured generates embeddings, 
      the new collections's name will be `u<short-workflow-id>_<short-embedding-model-name>_<number-of-dimensions>`. 
      If Unstructured does not generate embeddings, the new collections's name will be `u<short-workflow-id`.

  For [Unstructured Ingest](/open-source/ingestion/overview):

  - For the source connector only, an existing collection is required.
  - For the destination connector only, an existing collection is not required. At runtime, the collection behavior is as follows:
  
    - If an existing collection name is specified, and Unstructured generates embeddings, 
      but the number of dimensions that are generated does not match the existing collection's embedding settings, the run will fail. 
      You must change your Unstructured embedding settings or your existing collections's embedding settings to match, and try the run again. 
    - If a collection name is not specified, Unstructured creates a new collection in your Pinecone account. The new collection's name will be `unstructuredautocreated`.

  To create a collection yourself:

  a. After you sign in to DataStax, in the list of databases, click the name of the target database.<br/>
  b. On the **Data Explorer** tab, in the **Keyspace** list, select the name of the target keyspace.<br/>
  c. In the **Collections** list, select **Create collection**.<br/>
  d. Enter some **Collection name**.<br/>
  e. Turn on **Vector-enabled collection**, if it is not already turned on.<br/>
  f. For **Embedding generation method**, select **Bring my own**.<br/>
  g. For **Dimensions**, enter the number of dimensions for the embedding model that you plan to use.<br/>
  h. For **Similarity metric**, select **Cosine**.<br/>
  i. Click **Create collection**.<br/>
