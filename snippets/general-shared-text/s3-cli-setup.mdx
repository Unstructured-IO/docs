To use the AWS CLI to create an Amazon S3 bucket that allows all authenticated AWS IAM users in the 
corresponding AWS account to read and write to the bucket, do the following.

<Info>Your organization might have stricter bucket policy requirements. Check with your AWS account 
  administrator if you are unsure.</Info>

1. [Install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).
2. [Set up the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html).
3. Copy the following script to a file on your local machine, for example a file named `create-s3-bucket.sh`. 
   To change the following bucket policy to restrict it to a specific user in the AWS account, change `root` to that 
   specific username.

   In this script, replace the following:

   - Replace `<my-account-id>` with your AWS account ID.
   - Replace `<my-unique-bucket-name>` with the name of your bucket.
   - Replace `<us-east-1>` with your AWS Region.

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Set variables for the AWS account ID, Amazon S3 bucket name, and AWS Region.
   ACCOUNT_ID="<my-account-id>"
   BUCKET_NAME="<my-unique-bucket-name>"
   REGION="<us-east-1>"

   # Temporary filename for the bucket policy.
   # Do not change this variable.
   POLICY_FILE="bucket_policy.json"

   # Create the bucket.
   aws s3api create-bucket --bucket $BUCKET_NAME --region $REGION

   # Wait for the bucket to exist.
   echo "Waiting for bucket '$BUCKET_NAME' to be fully created..."
   aws s3api wait bucket-exists --bucket $BUCKET_NAME

   # Check if the wait command was successful.
   if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
       echo "The bucket '$BUCKET_NAME' has been fully created."
   else
       echo "Error: Timed out waiting for bucket '$BUCKET_NAME' to be created."
       exit 1
   fi

   # Remove the "block public policy" bucket access setting.
   aws s3api put-public-access-block \
       --bucket $BUCKET_NAME \
       --public-access-block-configuration \
       '{"BlockPublicPolicy": false, "IgnorePublicAcls": false, "BlockPublicAcls": false, "RestrictPublicBuckets": false}'

   # Check if the operation was successful.
   if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
       echo "The block public policy access setting was removed from '$BUCKET_NAME'."
   else
       echo "Error: Failed to remove the block public policy access setting from '$BUCKET_NAME'."
       exit 1
   fi

   # Create the bucket policy.
   cat << EOF > $POLICY_FILE
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "AllowAuthenticatedUsersInAccountReadWrite",

               "Principal": {
                   "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::$ACCOUNT_ID:root"
               },
               "Action": [
                   "s3:GetObject",
                   "s3:PutObject",
                   "s3:ListBucket",
                   "s3:DeleteObject"
               ],
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:s3:::$BUCKET_NAME",
                   "arn:aws:s3:::$BUCKET_NAME/*"
               ],
               "Condition": {
                   "StringEquals": {
                       "aws:PrincipalType": "IAMUser"
                   }
               }
           }
       ]
   }
   EOF

   # Apply the bucket policy.
   aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket $BUCKET_NAME --policy file://$POLICY_FILE

   # Check if the policy application was successful.
   if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
       echo "The bucket policy was applied to '$BUCKET_NAME'."
   else
       echo "Error: Failed to apply the bucket policy to '$BUCKET_NAME'."
       exit 1
   fi

   # Verify the applied policy.
   echo "Verifying the applied policy:"
   aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket $BUCKET_NAME --query Policy --output text

   # Remove the temporary bucket policy file.
   rm $POLICY_FILE
   ```

4. Run the script, for example:

   ```bash
   sh create-s3-bucket.sh
   ```

5. After the bucket is created, you can delete the script file, if you want.
