- A [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com).
- The **Google Drive API** enabled in the account. 
  [Learn how](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/getting-started#enabling_apis).
- Within the account, a Google Cloud service account and its related `credentials.json` key file or its contents in JSON format. 
  [Create a service account](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#create_a_service_account). 
  [Create credentials for a service account](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#create_credentials_for_a_service_account).

  To ensure maximum compatibility across Unstructured service offerings, you should give the service account key information to Unstructured as 
  a single-line string that contains the contents of the downloaded service account key file (and not the service account key file itself). 
  To print this single-line string without line breaks, suitable for copying, you can run one of the following commands from your Terminal or Command Prompt. 
  In this command, replace `<path-to-downloaded-key-file>` with the path to the `credentials.json` key file that you downloaded by following the preceding instructions.

  - For macOS or Linux: 

    ```text
    tr -d '\n' < <path-to-downloaded-key-file>
    ```

  - For Windows:

    ```text
    (Get-Content -Path "<path-to-downloaded-key-file>" -Raw).Replace("`r`n", "").Replace("`n", "")
    ```

- A [Google Drive folder](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375091).
- Give the service account access to the folder. To do this, share the folder with the service account's email address. 
  [Learn how](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/7166529). 
  [Learn more](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Workspace-Q-A/Can-i-give-access-to-document-of-google-drive-to-service-account/m-p/530106).  
- Get the folder's ID. This is a part of the URL for your Google Drive folder represented in the following URL as `{folder_id}`: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/{folder-id}`.

## Document permissions metadata

The source connector outputs any permissions information that it can find in the source location about the processed source documents and associates that information with each 
corresponding element that is generated. This permissions information is output into the `permissions_data` field, which is within the 
`data_source` field under the element's `metadata` field. This information lists the users or groups, if any, that have 
permissions to read, update, or delete the element's associated source document.

The following example shows what the output looks like. Ellipses indicate content that has been omitted from this example for brevity. 

```json
[
    {
        "...": "...",
        "metadata": {
            "...": "...",
