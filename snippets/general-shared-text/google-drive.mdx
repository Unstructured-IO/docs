1. A Google Cloud service account and its related `credentials.json` key file or its contents in JSON format. [Learn how](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#service-account).
2. To ensure maximum compatibility across Unstructured service offerings, you should give the service account key information to Unstructured as 
   a single-line string that contains the contents of the downloaded service account key file (and not the service account key file itself). 
   To print this single-line string without line breaks, suitable for copying, you can run one of the following commands from your Terminal or Command Prompt. 
   In this command, replace `<path-to-downloaded-key-file>` with the path to the `credentials.json` key file that you downloaded by following the preceding instructions.

   - For macOS or Linux: 

     ```text
     tr -d '\n' < <path-to-downloaded-key-file>
     ```

   - For Windows:

     ```text
     (Get-Content -Path "<path-to-downloaded-key-file>" -Raw).Replace("`r`n", "").Replace("`n", "")
     ```

3. Give the service account's email address access to the Google Drive folder. [Learn more](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Workspace-Q-A/Can-i-give-access-to-document-of-google-drive-to-service-account/m-p/530106).
4. Note the folder ID. This is a part of the URL for your Google Drive folder represented in the following URL as `{folder_id}`: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/{folder-id}`.
