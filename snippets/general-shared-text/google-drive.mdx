The Google Drive prerequisites:

1. A Google Cloud service account and its related `credentials.json` key file or its contents in JSON format. [Learn how](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#service-account).

2. Note the local path to the `credentials.json` key file. Or, copy the key file's contents into a compatible string&mdash;including properly escaped quotes&mdash;as required. 
   To make converting a JSON object into a compatible string easier, you can search the Internet by using a search phrase such as "tools for converting a JSON object into a string." 
   Before using any tool, check to make sure that the tool does not share the key file's contents with anyone you do not trust.

3. Give the service account's email address access to the Google Drive folder. [Learn more](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Workspace-Q-A/Can-i-give-access-to-document-of-google-drive-to-service-account/m-p/530106).

4. Note the folder ID. This is a part of the URL for your Google Drive folder represented in the following URL as `{folder_id}`: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/{folder-id}`.
