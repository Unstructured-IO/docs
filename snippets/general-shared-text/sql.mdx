The PostgreSQL or SQLite prerequisites.

For PostgreSQL:

- A PostgreSQL instance. [Install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-install.html). 
- The host name and port number for the instance. These values are in the `postgresql.conf` file's `listen_addresses` and `port` settings. This file should be on the same machine as the instance. These values might also already be set as environment variables named `PGHOST` and `PGPORT` on the same machine as the instance. 
- A database in the instance. [Create a database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-createdb.html).
- A table in the database. [Create a table](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-table.html). See also the [Sample index schema](#sample-index-schema).
- A user in the database, and a password for the user. [Create a user](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createuser.html).
- Database access for the user. [Give database access to a user](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-grant.html).

For SQLite:

- A SQLite instance. [Download and install SQLite](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/).
- A SQLite database. [Create a database](https://www.sqlite.org/quickstart.html).
- The path to the database's `.db` file.
- A table in the database. [Create a table](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html). See also the [Sample index schema](#sample-index-schema).
