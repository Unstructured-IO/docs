The PostgreSQL or SQLite prerequisites.

For PostgreSQL:

- A PostgreSQL instance. [Install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-install.html). 
- The host name and port number for the instance. These values are in the `postgresql.conf` file's `listen_addresses` and `port` settings. This file should be on the same machine as the instance. These values might also already be set as environment variables named `PGHOST` and `PGPORT` on the same machine as the instance. 
- A database in the instance. [Create a database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-createdb.html).
- A table in the database. [Create a table](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-table.html). See also the [Sample index schema](#sample-index-schema).

  The table's schema must match the schema of the documents that Unstructured produces. 
  Unstructured cannot provide a schema that is guaranteed to work in all 
  circumstances. This is because these schemas will vary based on your source files' types; how you 
  want Unstructured to partition, chunk, and generate embeddings; any custom post-processing code that you run; and other factors. See:

  - [CREATE TABLE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html) for PostgreSQL
  - [CREATE TABLE](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) for PostrgreSQL with pgvector
  - [Unstructured document elements and metadata](/api-reference/api-services/document-elements)

- A user in the database, and a password for the user. [Create a user](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createuser.html).
- Database access for the user. [Give database access to a user](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-grant.html).

For SQLite:

- A SQLite instance. [Download and install SQLite](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/).
- A SQLite database. [Create a database](https://www.sqlite.org/quickstart.html).
- The path to the database's `.db` file.
- A table in the database. [Create a table](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html). See also the [Sample index schema](#sample-index-schema).

  The table's schema must match the schema of the documents that Unstructured produces. 
  Unstructured cannot provide a schema that is guaranteed to work in all 
  circumstances. This is because these schemas will vary based on your source files' types; how you 
  want Unstructured to partition, chunk, and generate embeddings; any custom post-processing code that you run; and other factors. See:

  - [CREATE TABLE](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html) for SQLite
  - [Unstructured document elements and metadata](/api-reference/api-services/document-elements)
