The Elasticsearch prerequisites.

- For the [Unstructured Platform](/platform/overview), only Elastic Cloud instances are supported.
- For [Unstructured Ingest](/ingestion/overview), Elastic Cloud instances and self-manged Elasticsearch instances are supported.
- For Elastic Cloud, you will need an [Elastic Cloud service instance](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html#hosted-elasticsearch-service).

- For self-managed Elasticsearch, you will need a [self-managed Elasticsearch instance](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html#elasticsearch-deployment-options).

- You will need the name of the index on the instance. See [Create index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-create-index.html) and [Get index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-get-index.html).

  The Elasticsearch index that you use must have a schema that is compatible with the schema of the documents 
  that Unstructured produces for you. Unstructured cannot provide a schema that is guaranteed to work in all 
  circumstances. This is because these schemas will vary based on your source files' types; how you 
  want Unstructured to partition, chunk, and generate embeddings; any custom post-processing code that you run; and other factors. 

  You can adapt the following index schema example for your own needs:

  ```json
  {
      "settings": {
          "index": {
              "knn": true,
              "knn.algo_param.ef_search": 100
          }
      },
      "mappings": {
          "properties": {
              "element_id": {
                  "type": "keyword"
              },
              "text": {
                  "type": "text"
              },
              "embeddings": {
                  "type": "dense_vector",
                  "dims": 384,
                  "index": true,
                  "similarity": "cosine"
              },
              "metadata": {
                  "type": "object",
                  "properties": {
                      "parent_id": {
                          "type": "text"
                      },
                      "page_number": {
                          "type": "integer"
                      },
                      "is_continuation": {
                          "type": "boolean"
                      },
                      "orig_elements": {
                          "type": "text"
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- For Elastic Cloud, you will need the Elastic Cloud service instance's API key. If you are using Unstructured Ingest, you will also need the instance's Cloud ID. To get these, see your Elasticsearch Service web console.
- For self-managed Elasticsearch, you will need:

  - The self-managed instance's hostname and port number. See [Networking](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-network.html).
  - If you're using basic authentication to the self-managed instance, the user's name and password.
  - If you're using token-based authentication to the self-managed instance, the bearer token or API key for the instance. See [Token-based authentication services](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/token-authentication-services.html) and [Create API key](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api-create-api-key.html).
  - If you're using certificate authentication to the self-managed instance, the path to the Certificate Authority (CA) file on the instance, and the certificate fingerprint. See [SSL certificate API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api-ssl.html) and [Where can I see my Certificate Fingerprint?](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/where-can-i-see-my-certificate-fingerprint/319335/3).
