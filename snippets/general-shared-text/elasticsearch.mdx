The Elasticsearch prerequisites:

- An Elasticsearch instance, such as an [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html#hosted-elasticsearch-service) service instance, or a [self-managed Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html#elasticsearch-deployment-options) instance.
- The name of the index on the instance. See [Create index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-create-index.html) and [Get index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-get-index.html).

  The Elasticsearch index that you use must have a schema that is compatible with the schema of the documents 
  that Unstructured produces for you. Unstructured cannot provide a schema that is guaranteed to work in all 
  circumstances. This is because these schemas will vary based on your source files' types; how you 
  want Unstructured to partition, chunk, and generate embeddings; any custom post-processing code that you run; and other factors.

- If you're connecting to an Elastic Cloud instance, the Cloud ID and API key. To get these, see your Elasticsearch Service web console.
- If you're connecting to a self-managed instance, the instance's hostname and port number. See [Networking](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-network.html).
- If you're using basic authentication to the instance, the user's name and password.
- If you're using token-based authentication to the instance, the bearer token or API key for the instance. See [Token-based authentication services](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/token-authentication-services.html) and [Create API key](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api-create-api-key.html).
- If you're using certificate, the path to the Certificate Authority (CA) file on the instance, and the certificate fingerprint. See [SSL certificate API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api-ssl.html) and [Where can I see my Certificate Fingerprint?](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/where-can-i-see-my-certificate-fingerprint/319335/3).
