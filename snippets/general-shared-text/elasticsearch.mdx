- For the [Unstructured UI](/ui/overview) or the [Unstructured API](/api-reference/overview), only Elastic Cloud instances are supported.
- For [Unstructured Ingest](/open-source/ingestion/overview), Elastic Cloud instances and self-manged Elasticsearch instances are supported.
- For Elastic Cloud, you will need an [Elastic Cloud service instance](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html#hosted-elasticsearch-service).

- For self-managed Elasticsearch, you will need a [self-managed Elasticsearch instance](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html#elasticsearch-deployment-options).

- You will need the name of the index on the instance. 

  For the destination connector, if you need to create an index, you can use for example the following `curl` command. Replace the following placeholders:

  - Replace `<host>:<port>` with the instance's host identifier and port number.
  - Replace `<username>` with your Elasticsearch user name, and replace `<password>` with your password.
  - Replace `<index-name>` with the name of the new index on the instance.
  - Replace `<index-schema>` with the schema for the index. A schema is optional; see the explanation 
    following this `curl` command for more information.
  
  ```bash
  curl --request PUT "<host>:<port>/<index-name>" \
  --user "<username>:<password>" \
  [--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '<index-schema>']
  ```

  To learn more, see [Create index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-create-index.html) and [Get index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-get-index.html).

  For the destination connector, the index does not need to contain a schema beforehand. If Unstructured encounters an index without a schema, 
  Unstructured will automatically create a compatible schema for you before inserting items into the index. Nonetheless, 
  to reduce possible schema compatibility issues, Unstructured recommends that you create a schema that is compatible with Unstructured's schema. 
  Unstructured cannot provide a schema that is guaranteed to work in all 
  circumstances. This is because these schemas will vary based on your source files' types; how you 
  want Unstructured to partition, chunk, and generate embeddings; any custom post-processing code that you run; and other factors.

  You can adapt the following index schema example for your own needs:

  ```json
  {
      "settings": {
          "index": {
              "knn": true,
              "knn.algo_param.ef_search": 100
          }
      },
      "mappings": {
          "properties": {
              "record_id": {
                  "type": "text"
              },
              "element_id": {
                  "type": "keyword"
              },
              "text": {
                  "type": "text"
              },
              "embeddings": {
                  "type": "dense_vector",
                  "dims": 384,
                  "index": true,
                  "similarity": "cosine"
              },
              "metadata": {
                  "type": "object",
                  "properties": {
                      "parent_id": {
                          "type": "text"
                      },
                      "page_number": {
                          "type": "integer"
                      },
                      "is_continuation": {
                          "type": "boolean"
                      },
                      "orig_elements": {
                          "type": "text"
                      },
                      "partitioner_type": {
                          "type": "text"
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- For Elastic Cloud, you will need the Elastic Cloud service instance's API key. If you are using Unstructured Ingest, you will also need the instance's Cloud ID. To get these, see your Elasticsearch Service web console.
- For self-managed Elasticsearch, you will need:

  - The self-managed instance's hostname and port number. See [Networking](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-network.html).
  - If you're using basic authentication to the self-managed instance, the user's name and password.
  - If you're using token-based authentication to the self-managed instance, the bearer token or API key for the instance. See [Token-based authentication services](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/token-authentication-services.html) and [Create API key](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api-create-api-key.html).
  - If you're using certificate authentication to the self-managed instance, the path to the Certificate Authority (CA) file on the instance, and the certificate fingerprint. See [SSL certificate API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api-ssl.html) and [Where can I see my Certificate Fingerprint?](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/where-can-i-see-my-certificate-fingerprint/319335/3).
