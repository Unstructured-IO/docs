To get your Salesforce username, do the following:

1. Log in to your Salesforce account.
2. In the top navigation bar, click the **Quick Settings** (gear) icon, and then click **Open Advanced Setup**.
3. In the search box, search for and go to **Users**.
4. Note the **Name** value (_not_ the **User Name** value) for your user.

If you do not already have a Salesforce connected app, to create one, start by creating or getting the certificate (`.crt`) and private key (`.pem`) files 
that you will associate with the connected app. If you do not have the certificate and private key, you can use your local machine to create your own 
private key and self-signed certificate, if your organization allows, by running the following commands, one command at a time:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out MyPrivateKey.pem -traditional
openssl req -new -key MyPrivateKey.pem -out MyCertificateSigningRequest.csr
openssl x509 -req -in MyCertificateSigningRequest.csr -signkey MyPrivateKey.pem -out MyCertificate.crt -days 365
```

Be sure to store these generated files in a secure location.
