- A [Salesforce account](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup).
- Your Salesforce username. To get this username, do the following:

  1. Log in to your Salesforce account.
  2. In the top navigation bar, click the **Quick Settings** (gear) icon, and then click **Open Advanced Setup**.
  3. In the search box, search for and go to **Users**.
  4. Note the **Name** value (_not_ the **User Name** value) for your user.

- The Salesforce categories (objects) that you want to access, specified as a comma-separated list. 
  Available categories include `Account`, `Campaign`, `Case`, `EmailMessage`, and `Lead`.
- A Salesforce connected app in your Salesforce account.

  If you do not already have a Salesforce connected app, to create one, start by creating or getting the certificate (`.crt`) and private key (`.pem`) files 
  that you will associate with the connected app. 

  If you do not have the certificate and private key files, you can use the `openssl` utility on your local machine to create your own 
  private key and self-signed certificate, if your organization allows, by running the following commands, one command at a time:

  ```bash
  openssl genrsa -out MyPrivateKey.pem -traditional
  openssl req -new -key MyPrivateKey.pem -out MyCertificateSigningRequest.csr
  openssl x509 -req -in MyCertificateSigningRequest.csr -signkey MyPrivateKey.pem -out MyCertificate.crt -days 365
  ```

  Of course, you can change these example filenames as needed. Be sure to store these generated files in a secure location.

  To create a Salesforce connected app, do the following:

  1. Log in to your Salesforce account.
  2. In the top navigation bar, click the **Quick Settings** (gear) icon, and then click **Open Advanced Setup**.
  3. In the search box, search for and go to **App Manager**.
  4. Click **New Connected App**.
  5. With **Create a Connected App** selected, click **Continue**.
  6. At a minimum, fill in the following, and then click **Save**:

     - **Connected App Name**
     - **API Name** (can be the same as **Connected App Name**, but do not use spaces or punctuation)
     - **Contact Email**
     - Check **Enable OAuth Settings**.
     - For **Callback URL**, entering `https://localhost` is okay if you won't be using this connected app for other special authentication scenarios.
     - Check **Use Digital Signatures**. Click **Choose File**, and browse to and select your certificate (`.crt`) file.
     - For **Selected OAuth Scopes**, add the following:
     
       - **Manage user data via APIs (api)** and **Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)** (recommended); or 
       - **Full access (full)**
    
     - Uncheck **Require Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) Extension for Supported Authorization Flows**.
     - Uncheck **Require Secret for Web Server Flow**.
     - Uncheck **Require Secret for Refresh Token Flow**.
     - Check **Enable Authorization Code and Credentials Flow**.

  7. On the connected app's details page, click **Manage**, click **Edit Policies**, set the following under **OAuth Policies**, and then click **Save**:

     - Set **Permitted Users** to **All users may self-authorize**.
     - Set **IP Relaxation** to **Relax IP restrictions**.

- The OAuth consumer key (client ID) for the Salesforce connected app. 
  
  To get the Salesforce connected app's consumer key, do the following:

  1. Log in to your Salesforce account.
  2. In the top navigation bar, click the **Quick Settings** (gear) icon, and then click **Open Advanced Setup**.
  3. In the search box, search for and go to **App Manager**.
  4. In the list of apps, click the arrow next to the target connected app, and click **View**.
  5. Click **Manage Consumer Details**.
  6. Complete the on-screen security verification.
  7. Note the **Consumer Key** value.

- You must use your Salesforce account to do a one-time approval of the Salesforce connected app by using its consumer key and callback URL. To do this, while you are logged in to your 
  Salesforce account, browse to the following URL, replacing `<client-id>` with the consumer key. This URL assumes that the callback URL 
  is `https://localhost`:

  ```
  https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=<client-id>&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost
  ```

- To ensure maximum compatibility across Unstructured service offerings, you should give the private key information to Unstructured as 
  a single-line string that contains the contents of the private key (`.pem`) file (_not_ the private key file itself).  
  To print this single-line string without line breaks, suitable for copying, you can run one of the following commands from your Terminal or Command Prompt. 
  In this command, replace `<path-to-private-key-file>` with the path to the private key file.

  - For macOS or Linux: 

    ```bash
    awk 'NF {sub(/\r/, ""); printf "%s\\n",$0;}' <path-to-private-key-file>
    ```

    This command does the following:

    1. `NF` - Checks to make sure the private key file (`<path-to-private-key-file>`) is not empty. If the file is not empty, then the command continues. 
    2. `sub(/\r/, "")` - Replaces all carriage return characters (`\r`) with empty strings.
    3. `printf "%s\\n",$0` - Prints the resulting entire line, followed by a newline character, suitable for copying.

  - For Windows:

    ```text
    (Get-Content -Path "<path-to-private-key-file>" -Raw).Replace("`r`n", "\n")
    ```

    This command does the following:

    1. `Get-Content -Path "<path-to-private-key-file>" -Raw` - Reads the entire contents of the private key file as a single string.
    2. `Replace("rn", "\n")` - Replaces all Windows-style line endings (`\r\n`) with Unix-style line endings (`\n`).
    3. The modified string is printed, suitable for copying.
