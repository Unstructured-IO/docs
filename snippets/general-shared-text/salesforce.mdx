- The Salesforce categories (objects) that you want to access, specified as a comma-separated list. Available categories include `Account`, `Campaign`, `Case`, `EmailMessage`, and `Lead`.
- The OAuth consumer key (client ID) for the Salesforce connected app.

  1. If you do not already have a connected app, you will first need a certificate for the connected app that you will create later. If you do not already have a certificate, see 
     [Certificates and Keys](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.security_keys_about.htm&language=en_US&type=5), for 
     example to [generate a self-signed certificate](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.security_keys_creating.htm&type=5) and to download the 
     resulting `.crt` file.
  2. To [create the connected app](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create.htm&type=5), follow the steps in 
     [Configure Basic Connected App Settings](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create_basics.htm&type=5) and 
     [Enable OAuth Settings for API Integration](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create_api_integration.htm&type=5) to create 
     create and configure the app to use the JWT OAuth flow. The minimum fields to set for the app are:

     - **Connected App Name**
     - **API Name**
     - **Contact Email**
     - Check **Enable OAuth Settings**
     - **Callback URL** - Can be set to `https://localhost` if you have no special requirements for additional authentication for this app outside of Unstructured.
     - Check **Use digital signatures**, and 
     - **Selected OAuth Scopes** - Select **Manage user data via APIs (api)** (recommended), or **Full access (full)**.
  
  3. [Get the consumer key (client ID)](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_rotate_consumer_details.htm&type=5) for the app.
  4. [Get the private key](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.task_create_a_certificate_and_private_key.htm&type=5) for the app. 

- The private key (`.pem`) file for the certificate (`.crt`) file. To generate the private key file, you can use a utility such as `openssel`, as follows:

  ```bash
  openssl x509 -in MyCertificate.crt -out MyCertificate.pem -outform PEM
  ```

  To ensure maximum compatibility across Unstructured service offerings, you should give the private key information to Unstructured as 
  a single-line string that contains the contents of the downloaded private key file (and not the prviate key file itself). 
  This single-line string begins with `—–BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY—–` and ends with `—–END RSA PRIVATE KEY—–`. 
  To print this single-line string without line breaks, suitable for copying, you can run one of the following commands from your Terminal or Command Prompt. 
  In this command, replace `<path-to-downloaded-key-file>` with the path to the private key file that you generated by following the preceding instructions.

  - For macOS or Linux: 

    ```text
    tr -d '\n' < <path-to-downloaded-key-file>
    ```

  - For Windows:

    ```text
    (Get-Content -Path "<path-to-downloaded-key-file>" -Raw).Replace("`r`n", "").Replace("`n", "")
    ```
