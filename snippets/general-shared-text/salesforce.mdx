- A [Salesforce account](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup).
- Your Salesforce username. To get this username, do the following:

  1. Log in to your Salesforce account.
  2. In the top navigation bar, click the **Quick Settings** (gear) icon, and then click **Open Advanced Setup**.
  3. In the search box, search for and go to **Users**.
  4. Note the **Name** value (_not_ the **User Name** value) for your user.

- The Salesforce categories (objects) that you want to access, specified as a comma-separated list. 
  Available categories include `Account`, `Campaign`, `Case`, `EmailMessage`, and `Lead`.
- A Salesforce connected app in your Salesforce account.

  If you do not already have a Salesforce connected app, to create one, start by creating or getting the certificate (`.crt`) and private key (`.pem`) files 
  that you will associate with the connected app. 

  If you do not have the certificate and private key files, you can use the `openssl` utility on your local machine to create your own 
  private key and self-signed certificate, if your organization allows, by running the following commands, one command at a time:

  ```bash
  openssl genrsa -out MyPrivateKey.pem -traditional
  openssl req -new -key MyPrivateKey.pem -out MyCertificateSigningRequest.csr
  openssl x509 -req -in MyCertificateSigningRequest.csr -signkey MyPrivateKey.pem -out MyCertificate.crt -days 365
  ```

  Of course, you can change these example filenames as needed. Be sure to store these generated files in a secure location.

  To create a Salesforce connected app, do the following:

  1. Log in to your Salesforce account.
  2. In the top navigation bar, click the **Quick Settings** (gear) icon, and then click **Open Advanced Setup**.
  3. In the search box, search for and go to **App Manager**.
  4. Click **New Connected App**.
  5. With **Create a Connected App** selected, click **Continue**.
  6. At a minimum, fill in the following, and then click **Save**:

     - **Connected App Name**
     - **API Name** (can be the same as **Connected App Name**, but do not use spaces or punctuation)
     - **Contact Email**
     - Check **Enable OAuth Settings**.
     - For **Callback URL**, entering `http://localhost` is okay if you won't be using this connected app for other special authentication scenarios.
     - Check **Use Digital Signatures**. Click **Choose File**, and browse to and select your certificate (`.crt`) file.
     - For **Selected OAuth Scopes**, add **Manage user data via APIs (api)** (recommended) or **Full access (full)**.

- The OAuth consumer key (client ID) for the Salesforce connected app. 
  
  To get the Salesforce connected app's consumer key, do the following:

  1. Log in to your Salesforce account.
  2. In the top navigation bar, click the **Quick Settings** (gear) icon, and then click **Open Advanced Setup**.
  3. In the search box, search for and go to **App Manager**.
  4. In the list of apps, click the arrow next to the target connected app, and click **View**.
  5. Click **Manage Consumer Details**.
  6. Complete the on-screen security verification.
  7. Note the **Consumer Key** value.

- To ensure maximum compatibility across Unstructured service offerings, you should give the private key information to Unstructured as 
  a single-line string that contains the contents of the private key (`.pem`) file (_not_ the private key file itself).  
  To print this single-line string without line breaks, suitable for copying, you can run one of the following commands from your Terminal or Command Prompt. 
  In this command, replace `<path-to-private-key-file>` with the path to the private key file.

  - For macOS or Linux: 

    ```bash
    awk 'NF {sub(/\r/, ""); printf "%s\\n",$0;}' <path-to-private-key-file>
    ```

    This command does the following:

    1. `NF` - Checks to make sure the private key file (`<path-to-private-key-file>`) is not empty. If the file is not empty, then the command continues. 
    2. `sub(/\r/, "")` - Replaces all carriage return characters (`\r`) with empty strings.
    3. `printf "%s\\n",$0` - Prints the resulting entire line, followed by a newline character, suitable for copying.

  - For Windows:

    ```text
    (Get-Content -Path "<path-to-private-key-file>" -Raw).Replace("`r`n", "\n")
    ```

    This command does the following:

    1. `Get-Content -Path "<path-to-private-key-file>" -Raw` - Reads the entire contents of the private key file as a single string.
    2. `Replace("rn", "\n")` - Replaces all Windows-style line endings (`\r\n`) with Unix-style line endings (`\n`).
    3. The modified string is printed, suitable for copying.
