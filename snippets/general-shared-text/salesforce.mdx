- A Salesforce account. [Create an account](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup).
- Your Salesforce username.
- The Salesforce categories (objects) that you want to access, specified as a comma-separated list. Available categories include `Account`, `Campaign`, `Case`, `EmailMessage`, and `Lead`.
- The OAuth consumer key (client ID) for the target Salesforce connected app in the account. 
- The contents of the private key (PEM) for the certificate that is associated for the Salesforce connected app. The PEM must be expressed as a 
  single-line string without line breaks. To print this single-line string without line breaks, suitable for copying, 
  you can run one of the following commands from your Terminal or Command Prompt. In this command, replace 
  `<path-to-private-key-file>` with the path to the `.pem` file.

  For macOS or Linux:

  ```bash
  awk 'NF {sub(/\r/, ""); printf "%s\\n",$0;}' <path-to-private-key-file>
  ```

  For Windows:

  ```bash
  (Get-Content -Path "<path-to-private-key-file>" -Raw).Replace("`r`n", "\n")
  ```

To get your Salesforce username, do the following:

1. Log in to your Salesforce account.
2. In the top navigation bar, click the **Quick Settings** (gear) icon, and then click **Open Advanced Setup**.
3. In the search box, search for and go to **Users**.
4. Note the **Name** value (_not_ the **User Name** value) for your user.

If you do not already have a Salesforce connected app, to create one, start by creating or getting the certificate (`.crt`) and private key (`.pem`) files 
that you will associate with the connected app. If you do not have the certificate and private key, you can use your local machine to create your own 
private key and self-signed certificate, if your organization allows, by running the following commands, one command at a time:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out MyPrivateKey.pem -traditional
openssl req -new -key MyPrivateKey.pem -out MyCertificateSigningRequest.csr
openssl x509 -req -in MyCertificateSigningRequest.csr -signkey MyPrivateKey.pem -out MyCertificate.crt -days 365
```

Be sure to store these generated files in a secure location.

To create a Salesforce connected app, do the following:

   - Check **Enable OAuth Settings**.
   - For **Callback URL**, entering `http://localhost` is okay if you won't be using this connected app for other special authentication scenarios.
   - Check **Use Digital Signatures**. Click **Choose File**, and browse to and select your certificate (`.crt`) file.
   - For **Selected OAuth Scopes**, add **Manage user data via APIs (api)** (recommended) or **Full access (full)**.
