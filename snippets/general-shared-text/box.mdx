1. Access to the [Developer Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console) from your [Box enterprise account](https://account.box.com/signup/enterprise-plan) or [Box developer account](https://account.box.com/signup/developer).

2. A Box Custom App in your Box account, set up to use **Server Authentication (with JWT)**. See [Setup with JWT](https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/jwt/jwt-setup/).

3. The appropriate application scopes and advanced features set up for the Box Custom App, as follows:

   - In the Box Custom App, on the **Configuration** tab, under **Application Scopes**, check the box titled **Write all files and folders stored in Box**.
   - In the Box Custom App, on the **Configuration** tab, under **Advanced Features**, check the box titled **Make API calls using the as-user header**.
   - Click **Save Changes** before continuing.

4. Authorization by a Box Admin in your Box account for the Box Custom App. See [App Authorization](https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/jwt/jwt-setup/#app-authorization).

5. Access by your Box account's source or target [folder](https://app.box.com/folder/0) to your Box Custom App, as follows:

   - In the Box Custom App, on the **General Settings** tab, copy the **Service Account ID** (which takes the form `AutomationUser_<your-app-service-id>_<a-random-string@boxdevedition.com`).
   - **Share** your Box account's target folder with the copied service account's email address as a **Co-owner** or **Editor**. 
   - Note the remote URL to the target folder, which takes the format `box://<path/to/folder/in/account>`.

6. The private key configuration JSON file for the Box Custom App, or a string that contains this file's contents.

   - To download this file, in the Box Custom App, on the **Configuration** tab, under **Add and Manage Public Keys**, click **Generate a Public/Private Keypair**. Store the downloaded private key configuration JSON file in a secure location.
   - To ensure maximum compatibility across Unstructured service offerings, you should give the private key configuration JSON file information to Unstructured as 
   a single-line string that contains the contents of the downloaded private key configuration JSON file (and not the file itself). 
   To print this single-line string, suitable for copying, you can run one of the following commands from your Terminal or Command Prompt. 
   In this command, replace `<path-to-downloaded-key-file>` with the path to the private key configuration JSON file that you downloaded by following the preceding instructions.

     - For macOS or Linux: 

       ```text
       tr -d '\n' < <path-to-downloaded-key-file>
       ```

     - For Windows:

       ```text
       (Get-Content -Path "<path-to-downloaded-key-file>" -Raw).Replace("`r`n", "").Replace("`n", "")
       ```
