If you do not already have an Unstructured account, [sign up for free](https://unstructured.io/?modal=try-for-free).
After you sign up, you are automatically signed in to your new Unstructured **Starter** account, at [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io).

Do the following:

1. After you are signed in, the **Start** page appears.
2. In the **Welcome** area, do one of the following:

   - Click one of the sample files, such as **realestate.pdf**, to have Unstructured parse and transform that sample file.
   - Click **Browse files**, and then browse to and select one of your own files, to have Unstructured parse and transform it.

   ![Welcome interface on the Start page](/img/ui/single-file/welcome.png)

3. After Unstructured has finished parsing and transforming the file (a process known as 
   [partitioning](/ui/partitioning)), you will see the file's contents in the 
   center and Unstructured's results on the right. 

   ![Unstructured's parse and transform results](/img/ui/single-file/results.png)

4. The view on the right shows a formatted view of Unstructured's results, which is designed for human 
   readability. To see the underlying JSON view of the results, which is designed for RAG and agentic AI, 
   click **JSON** at the top of the view on the right side of the screen. 
   [Learn about what's in the JSON view](/ui/document-elements).

You can also do the following:

- To download the JSON view of the results as a local JSON file, click the download icon to the left of the **Formatted** and **JSON** buttons.

- To have Unstructured partition a different file, click **Add new file** on the left, and then browse to and select the target file.
- To view the results for a file that was previously partitioned during this session, click the file's name in the **Recent files** list on the left.
- To return to the **Start** page, click the **X** (close) button at the top left of the page, next to **Transform**.
- To have Unstructured do more than just partitioning, such as 
  [chunking](/ui/chunking), 
  [enriching](/ui/enriching/overview), 
  and [embedding](/ui/embedding), 
  click **Edit in Workflow Editor** at the top right of the page, or [skip over to the walkthrough](/ui/walkthrough).

- To get an associated code snippet that you can use to have Unstructured parse and transform a file programmatically instead of by using the Unstructured user interface, 
  click the down arrow next to **Copy curl command** at the top right of the page, and then do one of the following:

  ![Copying a related code snippet](/img/ui/single-file/get-code.png)

  - Click **Show options** to see the associated`curl`, Unstructured Python SDK, and Unstructured JavaScript/TypeScript SDK code snippets. Then do one of the following:

    - Click the **Copy** icon in the top right corner to copy the active code snippet to your system's clipboard.
    - Click **My API keys** to get your Unstructured API key, which is necessary when calling Unstructured programmatically.
    - Click **API Documentation** to learn how to set up, customize, and run the code.

  - Click **Copy curl command** to copy the `curl` code snippet to your system's clipboard without viewing the code snippet first.
  - Click **Copy Python SDK code** to copy the Unstructured Python SDK code snippet to your system's clipboard without viewing the code snippet first.
  - Click **Copy JavaScript code** to copy the Unstructured JavaScript/TypeScript SDK code snippet to your system's clipboard without viewing the code snippet first.
