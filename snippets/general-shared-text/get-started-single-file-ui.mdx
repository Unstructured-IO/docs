This quickstart shows how, in just a few minutes, you can use the Unstructured user interface (UI) to quickly and easily see Unstructured's 
best-in-class transformation results for a single file that is stored on your local computer.

<Tip>
    This quickstart focuses on a single, local file for ease-of-use demonstration purposes.
    
    To use Unstructured later to do 
    large-scale batch processing of multiple files and semi-structured data that are stored in remote locations, 
    [skip over](/ui/quickstart#remote-quickstart) to the remote quickstart after you finish this one.
</Tip>

If you do not already have an Unstructured account, [sign up for free](https://unstructured.io/?modal=try-for-free).
After you sign up, you are automatically signed in to your new Unstructured **Starter** account, at [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io).

Do the following:

1. After you are signed in, the **Start** page appears.
2. In the **Welcome** area, do one of the following:

   - Click one of the sample files, such as **realestate.pdf**, to have Unstructured parse and transform that sample file.
   - Click **Browse files**, and then browse to and select one of your own files, to have Unstructured parse and transform it.

     <Note>
         If you choose to use your own file, the file must be 10 MB or less in size.
     </Note>

3. After Unstructured has finished parsing and transforming the file (a process known as 
   [partitioning](/ui/partitioning)), you will see the file's contents in the 
   **Preview** pane in the center and Unstructured's results in the **Result** pane on the right. 

   ![Unstructured's parse and transform results](/img/ui/single-file/results.png)

4. The **Result** pane shows a formatted view of Unstructured's results by default. This formatted view is designed for human 
   readability. To see the underlying JSON view of the results, which is designed for RAG and agentic AI, 
   click **JSON** at the top of the **Result** pane. 
   [Learn about what's in the JSON view](/ui/document-elements).

   ![Switching to the JSON view of the results](/img/ui/single-file/json-view.png)

5. Unstructured's initial results are based on its **High Res** [partitioning strategy](/ui/partitioning), which 
   begins processing the file's contents and converting these contents into a series of Unstructured 
   [document elements and metadata](/ui/document-elements). This partitioning strategy provides good results overall, depending on the complexity of the file's contents. 
   This partioning strategy also generates a bounding box for each detected object in the file. A _bounding box_ is 
   an imaginary rectangular box drawn around the object to show its location and extent within the file.

   After the High Res partitioning results are shown, Unstructured begins improving these initial results by 
   using vision language models (VLMs) to apply a series of generative refinements known as _enrichments_. These 
   enrichments include:

   - An [image description](ui/enriching/image-descriptions) enrichment, which uses a VLM to provide a text-based summary of the contents of the each detected image.
   - A [generative OCR](/ui/enriching/generative-ocr) enrichment, which uses a VLM to improve the accuracy of each block of initially-processed text.
   - A [table to HTML](/ui/enriching/table-to-html) enrichment, which uses a VLM to provide an HTML-structured representation of each detected table.

   While these enrichments are being applied, a banner appears at the top of the **Result** pane.

   ![Updating the initial results with enrichments](/img/ui/single-file/generative-refinement.png)

   To see these enrichments applied to the initial results, click **Update results** in the banner as soon as this button appears, 
   which might take up to a minute or more.

6. To synchronize the scrolling of the **Preview** pane's selected contents with the **Result** pane's **Formatted** results, 
   rest your mouse pointer anywhere inside the contents of the **Preview** pane until a bounding box appears. 
   Then click the bounding box. Unstructured automatically scrolls the **Result** pane's **Formatted** 
   results to match the selected bounding box. (You cannot synchronize the scrolling of the **JSON** results.)

   ![Selecting a bounding box](/img/ui/single-file/bounding-box.png)

   To show all of the bounding boxes in the **Preview** pane at once, turn on the **Show all bounding boxes** toggle at the top of the **Preview** pane. 
   You can now click any of the bounding boxes without first needing to rest your mouse pointer on them to show them.

   ![Showing all bounding boxes](/img/ui/single-file/show-all-bounding-boxes.png)

You can also do the following:

- To download the JSON view of the results as a local JSON file, click the download icon to the left of the **Formatted** and **JSON** buttons in the **Result** pane. 
  (You cannot download the formatted view of the results.)

  ![Downloading the results as a local JSON file](/img/ui/single-file/download.png)

- To have Unstructured partition a different file, click **Add new file** in the **Files** pane on the left, and then browse to and select the target file. 
- To view the results for a file that was previously partitioned during this session, click the file's name in the **Recent files** list in the **Files** pane.
- To return to the **Start** page, click the **X** (close) button at the left on the title bar, next to **Transform**.
- To have Unstructured do more&mdash;such as 
  [chunking](/ui/chunking), [embedding](/ui/embedding),
  applying additional kinds of [enrichments](/ui/enriching/overview), and 
  processing larger files and semi-structured data in batches at scale&mdash;click 
  **Edit in Workflow Editor** at the right on the title bar, and then [skip over to the walkthrough](/ui/walkthrough-2).
