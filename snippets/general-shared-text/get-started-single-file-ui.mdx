If you do not already have an Unstructured account, [sign up for free](https://unstructured.io/?modal=try-for-free).
After you sign up, you are automatically signed in to your new Unstructured **Starter** account, at [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io).

Do the following:

1. After you are signed in, the **Start** page appears.
2. In the **Welcome** area, do one of the following:

   - Click one of the sample files, such as **realestate.pdf**, to have Unstructured parse and transform that sample file.
   - Click **Browse files**, and then browse to and select one of your own files, to have Unstructured parse and transform it.

   ![Welcome interface on the Start page](/img/ui/single-file/welcome.png)

3. After Unstructured has finished parsing and transforming the file (a process known as 
   [partitioning](/ui/partitioning)), you will see the file's contents in the 
   **Preview** pane in the center and Unstructured's results in the **Result** pane on the right.

4. The **Result** pane shows a formatted view of Unstructured's results by default. This formatted view is designed for human 
   readability. To see the underlying JSON view of the results, which is designed for RAG and agentic AI, 
   click **JSON** at the top of the **Result** pane. 
   [Learn about what's in the JSON view](/ui/document-elements).

5. To synchronize the scrolling of the **Preview** pane's selected contents with the **Result** pane's results, 
   rest your mouse pointer anywhere inside the contents of the **Preview** pane until a bounding box appears. 
   Then click the bounding box. Unstructured automatically scrolls the **Result** pane's results to match the selected bounding box.

   ![Selecting a bounding box](/img/ui/single-file/bounding-box.png)

   To show all of the bounding boxes in the **Preview** pane at once, turn on the **Show all bounding boxes** toggle at the top of the **Preview** pane. 
   You can now click any of the bounding boxes without first needing to rest your mouse pointer on them to show them.

You can also do the following:

- To download the JSON view of the results as a local JSON file, click the download icon to the left of the **Formatted** and **JSON** buttons in the **Result** pane.

- To have Unstructured partition a different file, click **Add new file** in the **Files** pane on the left, and then browse to and select the target file.
- To view the results for a file that was previously partitioned during this session, click the file's name in the **Recent files** list in the **Files** pane.
- To return to the **Start** page, click the **X** (close) button at the left on the title bar, next to **Transform**.
- To have Unstructured do more than just partitioning, such as 
  [chunking](/ui/chunking), 
  [enriching](/ui/enriching/overview), 
  and [embedding](/ui/embedding), 
  click **Edit in Workflow Editor** at the right on the title bar, or [skip over to the walkthrough](/ui/walkthrough).
