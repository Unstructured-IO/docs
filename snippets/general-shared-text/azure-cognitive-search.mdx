The Azure AI Search (formerly Azure Cognitive Search) prerequisites:

- The endpoint for Azure AI Search. [Get a search service endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-get-started-vector#get-a-search-service-endpoint).
- The API key for Azure AI Search. [Get an admin API key](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-get-started-vector#option-1-use-keys).
- The name of the index in Azure AI Search. [Create an index](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/create-index).

  The Azure AI Search index that you use must have an index schema that is compatible with the schema of the documents 
  that Unstructured produces for you. Unstructured cannot provide a schema that is guaranteed to work in all 
  circumstances. This is because these schemas will vary based on your source files' types; how you 
  want Unstructured to partition, chunk, and generate embeddings; any custom post-processing code that you run; and other factors.
