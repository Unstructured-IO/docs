     within the target COS instance, the target COS instance's matching endpoint (such as `https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud` for 
     **Dallas (us-south)**), and the target COS instance's matching access key and secret access key.
  10. Next to **Connection status**, click **Test connection** to test the connection. Do not proceed until **Successful** is shown. If the connection is 
      not successful, check the values you entered for the target bucket name, region, endpoint, access key, and secret access key, and try again.

  9. Enter some **Name** for the schema, and then click **Create**.
  10. On the sidebar, click **Query workspace**.
  11. In the SQL editor, enter and run a table creation statement such as the following, replacing `<catalog-name>` with the name of the target 
      catalog and `<schema-name>` with the name of the target schema:

      ```sql      
      CREATE TABLE <catalog-name>.<schema-name>.elements (
         "type" varchar,
         "element_id" varchar,
         "text" varchar,
         "file_directory" varchar,
         "filename" varchar,
         "languages" array(varchar),
         "last_modified" double,
         "page_number" varchar,
         "filetype" varchar,
         "url" varchar,
         "version" varchar,
         "record_locator" varchar,
         "date_created" double,
         "date_modified" double,
         "date_processed" double,
         "filesize_bytes" bigint,
         "points" varchar,
         "system" varchar,
         "layout_width" bigint,
         "layout_height" bigint,
         "id" varchar,
         "record_id" varchar,
         "parent_id" varchar
      )
      WITH (
         delete_mode = 'copy-on-write',
         format = 'PARQUET',
         format_version = '2'
      )
      ```

      Note that incoming elements that do not have matching column 
      names will be dropped upon record insertion. For example, if the incoming data has an element named `sent_from` and there is no 
      column named `sent_from` in the table, the `sent_from` element will be dropped upon record insertion. You should modify the preceding 
      sample table creation statement to add columns for any additional elements that you want to be included upon record 
      insertion.
