<Note>The `partition` methods and functions in the open source library process single files only. To process multiple files at a time, use the [Unstructured Ingest CLI](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-cli) or the [Unstructured Ingest Python library](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-python-library) with their provided [source connectors](/ingestion/source-connectors/overview) and [destination connectors](/ingestion/destination-connectors/overview).</Note>
