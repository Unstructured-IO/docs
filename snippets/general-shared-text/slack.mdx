- A Slack app. Create a Slack app by following [Step 1: Creating an app](https://api.slack.com/quickstart#creating).
- The app must have the the following OAuth scopes:

  - To read messages from public channels, add the scopes `channels:join` and `channels:history`.
  - To read messages from private channels, add the scope `groups:history`.
  
  Add these scopes to the app by following [Step 2: Requesting scopes](https://api.slack.com/quickstart#scopes).

- The app must be installed and authorized for the target Slack workspace. Install and authorize the app by following [Step 3: Installing and authorizing the app](https://api.slack.com/quickstart#installing).
- The app's access token. Get this token by following [Step 3: Installing and authorizing the app](https://api.slack.com/quickstart#installing).
- Add the app to the target channels in the Slack workspace. To do this from the channel, open the channel's details page, click the **Integrations** tab, click **Add apps**, and follow the on-screen directions to install the app.
