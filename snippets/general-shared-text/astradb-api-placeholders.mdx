- `<name>` (_required_) - A unique name for this connector.
- `<token>` (_required_) - The application token for the database.
- `<api-endpoint>` (_required_) - The database's associated API endpoint.
- `<collection-name>` - The name of the collection in the keyspace. If no value is provided, see the beginning of this article for the behavior at run time.
- `<keyspace>` - The name of the keyspace in the collection. The default is `default_keyspace` if not otherwise specified.
- `<batch-size>` - The maximum number of records to send per batch. The default is `20` if not otherwise specified.
- `flatten_metadata` - Set to `true` to flatten the metadata into each record. Specifically, when flattened, the metadata key values are brought to the top level of the element, and the `metadata` key itself is removed. By default, the metadata is not flattened (`false`).
- `binary_encode_vectors` - Set to `false` to upload vectors as a list of numbers. By default, vectors are binary encoded before sending (`true`). This is more efficient, but it makes it harder to view and work with vectors in the UI.
- `enable_lexical_search` - Set to `true` to enable lexical and hybrid search.
- `astra_generated_embeddings` - Set to `true` to use an Astra vectorize integration for embeddings.
