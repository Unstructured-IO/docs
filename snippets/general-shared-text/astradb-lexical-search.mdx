## Lexical search {#lexical-search}

When **Enable Lexical Search** is enabled, document text will be inserted into the `$lexical` field, enabling lexical and hybrid search capabilities in Astra DB.

**Important**: Your collection must be configured for lexical search, and your database must be in one of the supported AWS regions. See the [Astra DB documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/databases/lexical-search.html) for more information.

### Troubleshooting

#### Lexical search not enabled for collection

**Error**: `500: Error in uploader - [CollectionInsertManyException] CollectionInsertManyException(Lexical content can only be added and filtering and sort only be used on Collections for which Lexical feature is enabled. The Collection <keyspace>.<collection> does not have Lexical feature enabled. (LEXICAL_NOT_ENABLED_FOR_COLLECTION) [with 0 inserted ids])`

**Cause**: You enabled **Enable Lexical Search**, but your collection is not configured for lexical search.

**Solution**: Either disable **Enable Lexical Search** in your connector settings, or configure your collection for lexical search. Your database must also be in one of the supported AWS regions. See the [Astra DB documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/databases/lexical-search.html) for more information.
