The SingleStore prerequisites:

- A SingleStore deployment, database, and table. [Learn how](https://www.singlestore.com/blog/how-to-get-started-with-singlestore/).
- The hostname for the SingleStore deployment.
- The port for the host.
- The username for the deployment. 
- The password for the user.
- The name of the database in the deployment.
- The name of the table in the database.

  The table's schema must match the schema of the documents that Unstructured produces. 
  Unstructured cannot provide a schema that is guaranteed to work in all 
  circumstances. This is because these schemas will vary based on your source files' types; how you 
  want Unstructured to partition, chunk, and generate embeddings; any custom post-processing code that you run; and other factors. See:

  - [CREATE TABLE](https://docs.singlestore.com/cloud/reference/sql-reference/data-definition-language-ddl/create-table/) 
    in the SingleStore documentation
  - [Unstructured document elements and metadata](/api-reference/api-services/document-elements)

To get the values for the hostname, port, username, and password:

1. In your SingleStore account's dashboard sidebar, click **Deployments**.
2. From the drop-down list at the top of the **Deployments** page, select your deployment.
3. On the **Overview** tab, in the **Compute** area, in the **Connect** drop-down list for your deployment, select 
**Your App**. 
4. If a **Create User** dialog box appears, note the **User** name and **Password** values.
5. In the **Connect to Workspace** pane's **Your App** tab, note the string in the following format:

```
<user-name>:<password>@<host>:<port>
```

- `<user-name>` is the username.
- `<password>` is the user's password.
- `<host>` is the workspace's hostname.
- `<post>` is the host's port.

To get the values for the database and table names:

1. In your SingleStore dashboard's sidebar, click **Deployments**.
2. From the drop-down list at the top of the **Deployments** page, select your deployment.
3. On the **Databases** tab, note **Name** of your database.
4. Click the database and, on the **Tables** tab, note the name of your table.
