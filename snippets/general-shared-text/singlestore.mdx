The SingleStore prerequisites:

- A SingleStore deployment, database, and table. [Learn how](https://www.singlestore.com/blog/how-to-get-started-with-singlestore/).
- The hostname for the SingleStore deployment.
- The port for the host.
- The username for the deployment. 
- The password for the user.
- The name of the database in the deployment.
- The name of the table in the database.

  The table's schema must match the schema of the documents that Unstructured produces. 
  
  During insertion, JSON objects are flattened, and underscores are placed between nested object names. 
  For example, the following JSON object matches a column in the table named `data_source_date_created`:

  ```json
  {
      "...": "...",
      "data_source": {
          "date_created": "1719963233.949"
      },
      "...": "..."
  }
  ```

  The `metadata` object itself is also flattened in a similar way. However, for nested objects in `metadata`, 
  the column in the table does not start with `metadata_`. For example, the following JSON object matches a 
  column in the table named `last_modified`:

  ```json
  {
      "...": "...",
      "metadata": {
          "...": "...",
          "last_modified": "2022-12-16T17:04:16-05:00",
          "...": "..."
      },
      "...": "..."
  }
  ```

  Unstructured cannot provide a table schema that is guaranteed to work in all 
  circumstances. This is because these schemas will vary based on your source files' types; how you 
  want Unstructured to partition, chunk, and generate embeddings; any custom post-processing code that you run; and other factors.

  You can adapt the following table schema example for your own needs:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE elements (
      id INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      element_id TEXT,
      text TEXT,
      embeddings Vector(384),
      parent_id TEXT,
      page_number TEXT,
      is_continuation BOOLEAN,
      orig_elements TEXT
  );
  ```

To get the values for the hostname, port, username, and password:

1. In your SingleStore account's dashboard sidebar, click **Deployments**.
2. From the drop-down list at the top of the **Deployments** page, select your deployment.
3. On the **Overview** tab, in the **Compute** area, in the **Connect** drop-down list for your deployment, select 
**Your App**. 
4. If a **Create User** dialog box appears, note the **User** name and **Password** values.
5. In the **Connect to Workspace** pane's **Your App** tab, note the string in the following format:

```
<user-name>:<password>@<host>:<port>
```

- `<user-name>` is the username.
- `<password>` is the user's password.
- `<host>` is the workspace's hostname.
- `<post>` is the host's port.

To get the values for the database and table names:

1. In your SingleStore dashboard's sidebar, click **Deployments**.
2. From the drop-down list at the top of the **Deployments** page, select your deployment.
3. On the **Databases** tab, note **Name** of your database.
4. Click the database and, on the **Tables** tab, note the name of your table.
