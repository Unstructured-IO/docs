The Kafka prerequisites:

- A Kafka cluster, such as ones provided by [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud), [Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK)](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/), or [Google Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka](https://cloud.google.com/products/managed-service-for-apache-kafka).
- The hostname of the bootstrap Kafka cluster to connect to.  
- The port number of the cluster.
- The name of the topic to read messages from and write messages to on the cluster. 
- If you use Kafka API keys and secrets for authentication, the key and secret values.
