<Note>
    The following information applies to the legacy Unstructured Partition Endpoint.
    
    Unstructured recommends that you use the 
    [on-demand jobs](/api-reference/workflow/overview#run-an-on-demand-job) functionality in the 
    [Unstructured API](/api-reference/overview) instead. Unstructured's on-demand jobs provide 
    many benefits over the legacy Unstructured Partition Endpoint, including support for:

    - Production-level usage.
    - Multiple local input files in batches.
    - The latest and highest-performing models.
    - Post-transform enrichments.
    - All of Unstructured's chunking strategies.
    - The generation of vector embeddings.

    The Unstructured API also provides support for processing files and data in remote locations.
