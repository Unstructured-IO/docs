Unstructured offers different account types with different pricing plans:

- <Icon icon="person" />&nbsp;&nbsp;**Let's Go** and **Pay-As-You-Go** - A single user, with a single workspace, hosted alongside other accounts on Unstructured's cloud infrastructure.
- <Icon icon="building" />&nbsp;&nbsp;**Business** - Multiple users and workspaces, with three options:

  - <Icon icon="people-group" />&nbsp;&nbsp;**Business SaaS** - Hosted alongside other accounts on Unstructured's cloud infrastructure.
  - <Icon icon="shield-halved" />&nbsp;&nbsp;**Dedicated instance** - Hosted within a virtual private cloud (VPC) running inside Unstructured's cloud infrastructure. Dedicated instances are isolated from all other accounts, for additional security and control.
  - <Icon icon="shield" />&nbsp;&nbsp;**In-VPC** - Hosted within your own VPC on your own cloud infrastructure.

  **Business** accounts also allow for robust customization of Unstructured's features for your unique needs.
