Unstructured offers three account pricing plans:

- **SaaS Cloud-hosted** - Processing happens on Unstructured's software-as-a-service (SaaS) cloud infrastructure in a multi-tenant environment.
- **Private SaaS** - Processing also happens on Unstructured's SaaS cloud infrastructure, but your data stays protected in a dedicated cloud environment, maintaining strict data privacy.
- **VPC** - Sometimes referred to as [self-hosted](/self-hosted/overview), an instance of the Unstructured SaaS is deployed into your own virtual private cloud (VPC), providing complete data ownership and infrastructure control, full customization, and dedicated technical support.

For more details, see the [Unstructured Pricing](https://unstructured.io/pricing) page.

Some of these plans are billed on a per-page basis.
