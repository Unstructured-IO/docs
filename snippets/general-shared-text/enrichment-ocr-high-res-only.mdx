<Warning>
    Unstructured can produce generative OCR optimizations for workflows that are configured as follows:
    
    - With a **Partitioner** node set to use the **Auto** or **High Res** partitioning strategy, and a generative OCR optimizations node is added.  
    - With a **Partitioner** node set to use the **VLM** partitioning strategy. No generative OCR optimization node is needed (or allowed).
    
    Unstructured never produces generative OCR optimizations for workflows with a **Partitioner** node set to use the **Fast** partitioning strategy.
