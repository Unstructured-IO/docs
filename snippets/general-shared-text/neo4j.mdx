- A [Neo4j deployment](https://neo4j.com/deployment-center/).

  - For the [Unstructured Platform](/platform/overview), local Neo4j deployments are not supported.
  - For [Unstructured Ingest](/ingestion/overview), local and non-local Neo4j deployments are supported.

  The following video shows how to set up a Neo4j Aura deployment:

- The username and password for the user who has access to the Neo4j deployment. The default user is typically `neo4j`.

  - For a Neo4j Aura instance, the defaut user's is typically set when the instance is created.
  - For an AWS Marketplace, Microsoft Azure Marketplace, or Google Cloud Marketplace deployment of Neo4j, the default user is typically set during the deployment process.
  - For a local Neo4j deployment, you can [set the default user's initial password](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/set-initial-password/) or [recover an admin user and its password](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/password-and-user-recovery/).

- The connection URI for the Neo4j deployment, which starts with `neo4j://`, `neo4j+s://`, `bolt://`, or `bolt+s://`; followed by `localhost` or the host name; and sometimes ending with a colon and the port number (such as `:7687`). For example:

  - For a Neo4j Aura deployment, browse to the target Neo4j instance in the Neo4j Aura account and click **Connect > Drivers** to get the connection URI, which follows the format `neo4j+s://<host-name>`. A port number is not used or needed.
  - For an AWS Marketplace, Microsoft Azure Marketplace, or Google Cloud Marketplace deployment of Neo4j, see 
    [Neo4j on AWS](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/cloud-deployments/neo4j-aws/),
    [Neo4j on Azure](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/cloud-deployments/neo4j-azure/), or 
    [Neo4j on GCP](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/cloud-deployments/neo4j-gcp/) 
    for details about how to get the connection URI.
  - For a local Neo4j deployment, the URI is typically `bolt://localhost:7687`
  - For other Neo4j deployment types, see the deployment provider's documentation.

- The name of the target database in the Neo4j deployment. A default Neo4j deployment typically contains two standard databases: one named `neo4j` for user data and another 
  named `system` for system data and metadata. Some Neo4j deployment types support more than these two databases per deployment; 
  Neo4j Aura instances do not.  

  - [Create additional databases](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/database-administration/standard-databases/create-databases/) 
    for a local Neo4j deployment that uses Enterprise Edition; or for Neo4j on AWS, Neo4j on Azure, or Neo4j on GCP deployments.
