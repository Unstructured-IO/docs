<Note>
    If you're new to Unstructured, read this note first.
    
    Before you can create a destination connector, you must first sign in to your Unstructured account:
    
    - If you do not already have an Unstructured account, you can sign up for a single-user **Starter** account at 
      [https://unstructured.io/developers](https://unstructured.io/developers). To sign up for a **Team** or **Enterprise** 
      account instead, [contact us](https://unstructured.io/contact).
    - If you already have an Unstructured **Starter** or **Team** account, sign in to your account at 
      [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io). For an **Enterprise** account, see your 
      Unstructured account administrator or Unstructured Sales representative.

    After you sign in, the [Unstructured user interface](/ui/overview) (UI) appears, which you use to get your Unstructured API key.

    1. After you sign in to your Unstructured **Starter** account, click **API Keys** on the sidebar.<br/>

       For **Team** and **Enterprise** accounts, before you click **API Keys**, make sure you have selected the organizational workspace you want to create an API key 
       for. Each API key works with one and only one organizational workspace. [Learn more](/ui/account/workspaces#create-an-api-key-for-a-workspace).

    2. Click **Generate API Key**.<br/>
    3. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish generating the key.<br/>
    4. Click the **Copy** icon next to your new key to add the key to your system's clipboard. If you lose this key, simply return and click the **Copy** icon again.<br/>

    After you create the destination connector, add it along with a 
    [source connector](/api-reference/workflow/sources/overview) to a [workflow](/api-reference/workflow/overview#workflows). 
    Then run the worklow as a [job](/api-reference/workflow/overview#jobs). To learn how, try out the 
    [hands-on Workflow Endpoint quickstart](/api-reference/workflow/overview#quickstart), 
    go directly to the [quickstart notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Unstructured-IO/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/Unstructured_Platform_Workflow_Endpoint_Quickstart.ipynb), 
    or watch the two 4-minute video tutorials for the [Unstructured Python SDK](/api-reference/workflow/overview#unstructured-python-sdk).
    
    You can also create destination connectors with the Unstructured user interface (UI). 
    [Learn how](/ui/destinations/overview).

    If you need help, reach out to the [community](https://short.unstructured.io/pzw05l7) on Slack, or 
    [contact us](https://unstructured.io/contact) directly.

    You are now ready to start creating a destination connector! Keep reading to learn how.
