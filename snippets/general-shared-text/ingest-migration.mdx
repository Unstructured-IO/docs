The older `unstructured` versions of the [Unstructured Ingest CLI](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-cli) and [Unstructured Ingest Python library](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-python-library) have been replaced and are now deprecated.

To migrate to the newer [unstructured-ingest](https://pypi.org/project/unstructured-ingest/) versions of the Ingest CLI and Ingest Python library, do the following:

1. If you previously ran `pip install unstructured` **only** for the purposes of using the Ingest CLI or the Ingest Python library, upgrade to the latest versions by running the following commands:

   a. `pip uninstall unstructured`<br/>
   b. `pip install unstructured-ingest`

2. If you previously installed an older version of a source or destination connector, for example `pip install "unstructured[azure]"` for the Azure Storage connector, upgrade to the latest version by running the following commands:

   a. `pip uninstall "unstructured[azure]"`<br/>
   b. `pip install "unstructured-ingest[azure]"`

3. If you were running Python code against an older version of the Ingest Python library, update your `import` statements by replacing all instances of `unstructured.ingest` with `unstructured_ingest` to run against the latest version.
