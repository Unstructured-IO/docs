- For the [Unstructured Platform](/platform/overview), local PostgreSQL installations are not supported.
- For [Unstructured Ingest](/ingestion/overview), local and non-local PostgreSQL installations are supported.

The following video shows for example how to get these settings by using [Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/):

- A PostgreSQL instance. [Install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-install.html). 
- The host name and port number for the instance. 

  - For Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, learn how to [get the host name and port number](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ConnectToPostgreSQLInstance.html#postgresql-endpoint).
  - For local PostgreSQL installations, these values are in the `postgresql.conf` file's `listen_addresses` and `port` settings. This file should be on the same machine as the instance. These values might also already be set as environment variables named `PGHOST` and `PGPORT` on the same machine as the instance. 
  - For other installation types, see your PostgreSQL provider's documentation.

- A database in the instance. 

  - For Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, the default database name is `postgres` unless a custom database name was specified during the instance creation process.
  - For local PostgreSQL installations, learn how to [create a database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-createdb.html).
  - For other installation types, see your PostgreSQL provider's documentation.

- A table in the database. Learn how to [create a table](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-table.html).

  The table's schema must match the schema of the documents that Unstructured produces. 
  Unstructured cannot provide a schema that is guaranteed to work in all 
  circumstances. This is because these schemas will vary based on your source files' types; how you 
  want Unstructured to partition, chunk, and generate embeddings; any custom post-processing code that you run; and other factors. 
  
  You can adapt the following table schema example for your own needs:

  <CodeGroup>
    ```sql PostgreSQL
    CREATE TABLE elements (
        id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
        element_id VARCHAR,
        record_id TEXT,
        text TEXT,
        embeddings DECIMAL [],
        parent_id VARCHAR,
        page_number INTEGER,
        is_continuation BOOLEAN,
        orig_elements TEXT
    );
    ```
    
    ```sql PostgreSQL with pgvector 
    CREATE EXTENSION vector;
    
    CREATE TABLE elements (
        id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
        element_id VARCHAR,
        record_id TEXT,
        text TEXT,
        embeddings vector(3072),
        parent_id VARCHAR,
        page_number INTEGER,
        is_continuation BOOLEAN,
        orig_elements TEXT
    );
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
