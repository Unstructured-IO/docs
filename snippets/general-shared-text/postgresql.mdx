The following video shows for example how to get these settings by using [Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/):

- A PostgreSQL instance. [Install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-install.html). 
- The host name and port number for the instance. These values are in the `postgresql.conf` file's `listen_addresses` and `port` settings. This file should be on the same machine as the instance. These values might also already be set as environment variables named `PGHOST` and `PGPORT` on the same machine as the instance. 
- Depending on your network security requirements, you might need to allow access to your instance only from specific IP addresses.

  <AllowIPAddressRanges />

  To learn how to allow these IP address ranges, see your PostgreSQL provider's documentation, for example with 
  [Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.RDSSecurityGroups.html).

- A database in the instance. [Create a database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-createdb.html).
- A table in the database. [Create a table](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-table.html).

  The table's schema must match the schema of the documents that Unstructured produces. 
  Unstructured cannot provide a schema that is guaranteed to work in all 
  circumstances. This is because these schemas will vary based on your source files' types; how you 
  want Unstructured to partition, chunk, and generate embeddings; any custom post-processing code that you run; and other factors. 
  
  You can adapt the following table schema example for your own needs:

  <CodeGroup>
    ```sql PostgreSQL
    CREATE TABLE elements (
        id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
        element_id VARCHAR,
        text TEXT,
        embeddings DECIMAL [],
        parent_id VARCHAR,
        page_number INTEGER,
        is_continuation BOOLEAN,
        orig_elements TEXT
    );
    ```
    
    ```sql PostgreSQL with pgvector 
    CREATE EXTENSION vector;
    
    CREATE TABLE elements (
        id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
        element_id VARCHAR,
        text TEXT,
        embeddings vector(384),
        parent_id VARCHAR,
        page_number INTEGER,
        is_continuation BOOLEAN,
        orig_elements TEXT
    );
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
