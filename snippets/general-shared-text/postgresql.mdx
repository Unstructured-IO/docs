- For the [Unstructured UI](/ui/overview) or the [Unstructured API](/api/overview), local PostgreSQL installations are not supported.
- For [Unstructured Ingest](/ingestion/overview), local and non-local PostgreSQL installations are supported.

- A PostgreSQL instance. 

  - [Create an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_GettingStarted.CreatingConnecting.PostgreSQL.html).
  - [Create an Azure Database for PostgreSQL server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/how-to-deploy-on-azure-free-account).
  - [Install PostgreSQL locally](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-install.html). 

- The host name and port number for the instance. 

  - For Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, learn how to [get the host name and port number](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ConnectToPostgreSQLInstance.html#postgresql-endpoint).
  - For Azure Database for PostgreSQL, learn how to [get the host](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/quickstart-create-server#get-the-connection-information). The port number is `5432`.
  - For local PostgreSQL installations, these values are in the `postgresql.conf` file's `listen_addresses` and `port` settings. This file should be on the same machine as the instance. These values might also already be set as environment variables named `PGHOST` and `PGPORT` on the same machine as the instance. 
  - For other installation types, see your PostgreSQL provider's documentation.

- Depending on your network security requirements, you might need to allow access to your instance only from specific IP addresses.

  <AllowIPAddressRanges />

  To learn how to allow these IP address ranges, see your PostgreSQL provider's documentation, for example with 
  [Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.RDSSecurityGroups.html) or 
  [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/how-to-manage-firewall-portal#create-a-firewall-rule-after-server-is-created).

  <Note>
      For Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, Amazon recommends that you set the instance's **Public access** setting to **No** by default, as this 
      approach is more secure. This means that no 
      resources can connect to the instance outside of the instance's associated Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) without extra configuration. 
      [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html#USER_VPC.Hiding). 
      [Access an Amazon RDS instance in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.Scenarios.html).

      If you must enable public access, set the instance's **Public access** setting to **Yes**, and then adjust the instance's related 
      security group to allow this access.

  </Note>

- A database in the instance. 

  - For Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL and Azure Database for PostgreSQL, the default database name is `postgres` unless a custom database name was specified during the instance creation process.
  - For local PostgreSQL installations, learn how to [create a database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-createdb.html).
  - For other installation types, see your PostgreSQL provider's documentation.

- A table in the database. Learn how to [create a table](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-table.html).

  The table's schema must match the schema of the documents that Unstructured produces. 
  Unstructured cannot provide a schema that is guaranteed to work in all 
  circumstances. This is because these schemas will vary based on your source files' types; how you 
  want Unstructured to partition, chunk, and generate embeddings; any custom post-processing code that you run; and other factors. 
  
  You can adapt the following table schema example for your own needs:

  <CodeGroup>
    ```sql PostgreSQL
    CREATE TABLE elements (
        id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
        record_id VARCHAR,
        element_id VARCHAR,
        text TEXT,
        embeddings DECIMAL [],
        parent_id VARCHAR,
        page_number INTEGER,
        is_continuation BOOLEAN,
        orig_elements TEXT,
        partitioner_type VARCHAR
    );
    ```
    
    ```sql PostgreSQL with pgvector 
    CREATE EXTENSION vector;
    
    CREATE TABLE elements (
        id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
        record_id VARCHAR,
        element_id VARCHAR,
        text TEXT,
        embeddings vector(3072),
        parent_id VARCHAR,
        page_number INTEGER,
        is_continuation BOOLEAN,
        orig_elements TEXT,
        partitioner_type VARCHAR
    );
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
