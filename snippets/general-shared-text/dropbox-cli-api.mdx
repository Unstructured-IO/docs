The Dropbox connector dependencies:

```bash CLI, Python
pip install "unstructured-ingest[dropbox]"
```

import AdditionalIngestDependencies from '/snippets/general-shared-text/ingest-dependencies.mdx';

<AdditionalIngestDependencies />

The following environment variables:

- `DROPBOX_REMOTE_URL` - The remote URL to the target subfolder inside of the app folder for the Dropbox app, represented by `--remote-url` (CLI) or `remote_url` (Python).
- `DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` - The value of the access token for the Dropbox app that is associated with the target app folder, represented by `--token` (CLI) or `token` (Python). 
  Provide this only if for some reason you do not want Unstructured to automatically refresh expired access tokens. 

To have Unstructured automatically refresh expired Dropbox App access tokens on your behalf, do not provide an access token. Instead, provide the following environment variables:

- `DROPBOX_REFRESH_TOKEN` - The value of the refresh token for the corresponding access token, represented by `--refresh-token` (CLI) or `refresh_token` (Python).
- `DROPBOX_APP_KEY` - The app key for the Dropbox app, represented by `--app-key` (CLI) or `app_key` (Python).
- `DROPBOX_APP_SECRET` - The app secret for the Dropbox app, represented by `--app-secret` (CLI) or `app_secret` (Python).
