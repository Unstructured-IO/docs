<Note>
    For the destination connector, Unstructured recommends that all documents in the target collection have a field 
    named `record_id` with a `String` data type. 
    Unstructured can use this field to do intelligent document overwrites. Without this field, duplicate documents 
    might be written to the collection or, in some cases, the operation could fail altogether.
