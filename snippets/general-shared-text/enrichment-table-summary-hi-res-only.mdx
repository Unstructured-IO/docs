<Warning>
    Unstructured can potentially generate table summary descriptions only for workflows that are configured as follows:
    
    - With a **Partitioner** node set to use the **Auto** or **High Res** partitioning strategy, and a table summary description node is added.  
    - With a **Partitioner** node set to use the **VLM** partitioning strategy. No table summary description node is needed (or allowed).
    
    Even with these configurations, Unstructured actually generates table summary descriptions only for files that contain tables and are also eligible 
    for processing with the following partitioning strategies:
    
    - **High Res**, when the workflow's **Partitioner** node is set to use **Auto** or **High Res**.
    - **VLM** or **High Res**, when the workflow's **Partitioner** node is set to use **VLM**.

    Unstructured never generates table summary descriptions for workflows that are configured as follows:
    
    - With a **Partitioner** node set to use the **Fast** partitioning strategy.
    - With a **Partitioner** node set to use the **Auto**, **High Res**, or **VLM** partitioning strategy, for all files that Unstructured encounters that do not contain tables.
