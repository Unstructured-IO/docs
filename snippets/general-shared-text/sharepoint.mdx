<Note>
    If you are setting up the SharePoint connector for the first time, you can skip past this note.
    
    Previous versions of the SharePoint connector relied on SharePoint app principals for authentication. Current versions of the 
    SharePoint connector no longer support these SharePoint app principals. Microsoft deprecated support for Share Point app principals on November 27, 2023. 
    SharePoint app principals will no longer work for SharePoint tenants that were created on or after November 1, 2024, and they will stop working 
    for all SharePoint tenants as of April 2, 2026. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/retirement-announcement-for-azure-acs). 

    Current versions of the SharePoint connector now rely on Microsoft Entra ID app registrations for authentication. 

    To migrate from SharePoint app princpals to Entra ID app regisrations, replace the following settings in your existing SharePoint connector, 
    as listed in the requirements following this note:

    - Replace the deprecated SharePoint app principal's application client ID value with your replacement Entra ID app registration's **Application (client) ID** value.
    - Replace the deprecated SharePoint app principal's client secret value with your replacement Entra ID app registration's **Client secret** value.
    - Add your replacement Entra ID app registration's **Directory (tenant) ID** value, token authority URL value, and the correct set of Microsoft Graph access permissions for SharePoint Online.

    If you need migration help, get assistance from our [Slack community](https://short.unstructured.io/pzw05l7), or email Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).

- A OneDrive for business plan, or a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 Business or enterprise plan that includes OneDrive. 
  (Even if you only plan to use SharePoint Online, you still need a plan that includes OneDrive, because the SharePoint connector is built on OneDrive technology.)

  OneDrive personal accounts, and Microsoft 365 Free, Basic, Personal, and Family plans are not supported.
- The SharePoint Online and OneDrive plans must share the same Microsoft Entra ID tenant. 
  [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/subscriptions-licenses-accounts-and-tenants-for-microsoft-cloud-offerings?view=o365-worldwide). 
- The SharePoint Online site URL.

  - Site collection-level URLs typically have the format `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<site-collection-name>`.
  - Root site collection-level URLs typically have the format `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com`. 
  - To process all sites within a SharePoint tenant, use a site URL of `https://<tenant>-admin.sharepoint.com`.

  [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/community/query-string-url-tricks-sharepoint-m365).

- The display name of the SharePoint Online library to use. The default is `Documents`.
- The path to the SharePoint Online library to use. By default, the root of the target library is used. 
  To start from a path other than the root, enter the path that you want to use, beginning from the root. For example, to use 
  the **my-folder > my-subfolder** path in the target library, you would specify `my-folder/my-subfolder`.

  The following video shows how to get the site URL and a path within the site:

- Two types of authentication are supported: client credentials and a username and password. Both authentication types require a 
  Microsoft Entra ID app registration. You will need to provide 
  the **Application (client) ID**, **Directory (tenant) ID**, and **Client secret** for the Entra ID app registration, and the 
  app registration must have the correct set of Microsoft Graph access permissions. These permissions include:

  - `Sites.ReadWrite.All` (if both reading and writing are needed)
  - `User.Read.All`

- The token authority URL for your Microsoft Entra ID app registration. This is typically `https://login.microsoftonline.com`
- For username and password authentication, you must also provide the User Principal Name (UPN) and its password for the OneDrive account in the Microsoft Entra ID tenant. This UPN is typically the OneDrive account user's email address. To find a UPN:

  1. Depending on your plan, sign in to your Microsoft 365 admin center (typically [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)) using your administrator credentials, 
     or sign in to your Office 365 portal (typically [https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com)) using your credentials.
  2. In the **Users** section, click **Active users**.
  3. Locate the user account in the list of active users.
  4. The UPN is displayed in the **Username** column.
