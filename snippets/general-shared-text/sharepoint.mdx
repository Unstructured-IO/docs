- The SharePoint site URL.

  - Site collection-level URLs typically have the format `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<site-collection-name>`.
  - Root site collection-level URLs typically have the format `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com`. 
  - To process all sites within a tenant, use a site URL of `https://<tenant>-admin.sharepoint.com`.

- The path in the SharePoint site from which to start parsing files, for example `"Shared Documents"`. If the connector is to process all sites within the tenant, this filter will be applied to all site document libraries.
- A SharePoint app principal with its application (client) ID, client secret, and the appropriate access permissions. 

  Complete the steps in the following sections, depending on whether you want to access sites at the site collection level, the 
  root site collection level, or all sites within a tenant. 
  
  <Note>
      Two of the main factors in the following sections are the scope of access 
      and the level of administrative permissions required to create the app principal. Tenant-wide app principals offer the broadest access 
      but require the highest level of administrative rights, while site collection app principals are more restricted but can be created by users 
      with lower-level permissions.
  </Note>

## Tenant-wide SharePoint app principals

Create a tenant-wide SharePoint app principal when you want the power and flexibility of a principal that can process all sites within a tenant. 

SharePoint app principals that are created in the SharePoint admin center have tenant-wide scope and can potentially access all sites within the tenant. 
Only global or SharePoint administrators typically have access to the following URLs.

1. To create a tenant-wide SharePoint app principal and then get its client ID and client secret, go to the following URL:

   `https://<tenant>-admin.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/appregnew.aspx`

2. To add access permissions to a tenant-wide SharePoint app principal and then get its client ID and client secret, go to the following URL:

   `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/appinv.aspx`

3. Apply the following permissions XML to the tenant-wide SharePoint app principal:

   ```xml
   <AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy="true">
       <AppPermissionRequest Scope="http://sharepoint/content/tenant" Right="FullControl" />
   </AppPermissionRequests>
   ```
   Available `Right` settings include `Read`, `Write`, `Manage`, and `FullControl`. To learn more, see 
   [Add-in permissions in SharePoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/add-in-permissions-in-sharepoint).

Be sure to substitute the URLs and XML in the linked article with the ones in these preceding steps accordingly.

## Root site collection-level SharePoint app principals

Create a root site collection-level SharePoint app principal when you want a principal that can only access a root site collection, for example with a URL 
that has the format `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com`.

SharePoint app principals that are created at the root site collection level have a scope limited to the root site collection. Site collection administrators can usually access the following URLs.

1. To create a root site collection-level SharePoint app principal and then get its client ID and client secret, go to the following URL:

   `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/appregnew.aspx`

2. To add access permissions to a root site collection-level SharePoint app principal, go to the following URL:

   `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/appinv.aspx`

3. Apply the following permissions XML to the root site collection-level SharePoint app principal:

   ```xml
   <AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy="true">
       <AppPermissionRequest Scope="http://sharepoint/content/sitecollection" Right="FullControl" />
   </AppPermissionRequests>
   ```

   Available `Right` settings include `Read`, `Write`, `Manage`, and `FullControl`. To learn more, see 
   [Add-in permissions in SharePoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/add-in-permissions-in-sharepoint).

Be sure to substitute the URLs and XML in the linked article with the ones in these preceding steps accordingly.

## Site collection-level SharePoint app principals

Create a site collection-level SharePoint app principal when you want a principal that can only access a specific site collection, for example with a URL 
that has or starts with the format `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<site-collection-name>`.

SharePoint app principals that are created at the site collection level have the most limited scope, restricted to the specific subsite and its subsites. 
Site owners or those with appropriate permissions on the subsite can access the following URLs.

1. To create a site collection-level SharePoint app principal, go to the following URL:

   `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<site-collection-name>/_layouts/15/appregnew.aspx`

2. To add access permissions to a site collection-level SharePoint app principal, go to the following URL:

   `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<site-collection-name>/_layouts/15/appinv.aspx`

3. Apply the following permissions XML to the site collection-level SharePoint app principal:

   ```xml
   <AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy="true">
       <AppPermissionRequest Scope="http://sharepoint/content/sitecollection" Right="FullControl" />
   </AppPermissionRequests>
   ```

   Available `Right` settings include `Read`, `Write`, `Manage`, and `FullControl`. To learn more, see
