- The SharePoint site URL.

  - Site URLs typically have the format `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com`.
  - Relative site URLs typically have the format `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<site_name>`. 
  - To process all sites within a tenant, use a site URL of `https://<tenant>-admin.sharepoint.com`. This requires the app to be registered at a tenant level.

- The path in the SharePoint site from which to start parsing files, for example `"Shared Documents"`. If the connector is to process all sites within the tenant, this filter will be applied to all site document libraries.
- A SharePoint app principal with its application (client) ID, client secret, and access permissions to the SharePoint instance. [Get a client ID and client secret, and set access permissions](https://github.com/vgrem/Office365-REST-Python-Client/wiki/How-to-connect-to-SharePoint-Online-and-and-SharePoint-2013-2016-2019-on-premises--with-app-principal).

  For a SharePoint app principal with site-scoped permissions, use app permission request XML such as the following to grant 
  permissions through `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/appinv.aspx`:

  ```xml
  <AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy="true">
    <AppPermissionRequest Scope="http://sharepoint/content/sitecollection" Right="FullControl" />
  </AppPermissionRequests>
  ```

  For a SharePoint app principal with tenant-scoped permissions, use app permission request XML such as the following to grant 
  permissions through `https://<tenant>-admin.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/appinv.aspx` instead:

  ```xml
  <AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy="true">
    <AppPermissionRequest Scope="http://sharepoint/content/tenant" Right="FullControl" />
  </AppPermissionRequests>
  ```

  Available `Right` settings include `Read`, `Write`, `Manage`, and `FullControl`. To learn more, see
