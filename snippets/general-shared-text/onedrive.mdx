- [A Microsoft 365 or Office 365 plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-plan-options) that includes 
  both OneDrive and SharePoint Online. (Even if you only plan to use OneDrive, you still need a plan that includes SharePoint Online, 
  because OneDrive is built on SharePoint technology.)
- The User Principal Name (UPN) for the OneDrive account. This is typically the OneDrive account user's email address. To find a UPN:

  1. Depending on your plan, sign in to your Microsoft 365 admin center (typically [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)) using your administrator credentials, 
     or sign in to your Office 365 portal (typically [https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com)) using your credentials.
  2. In the **Users** section, click **Active users**.
  3. Locate the user account in the list of active users.
  4. The UPN is displayed in the **Username** column.

- The path to the target OneDrive folder, starting from the OneDrive account's root folder, for example `my-folder/my-subfolder`.
- The client ID, tenant ID, and client secret for the Microsoft Entra ID app registration that has access to the target OneDrive account and 
  also has the correct set of Microsoft Graph access permissions. These permissions include:

  - `Files.ReadWrite.All` (if both reading and writing are needed)
  - `Sites.ReadWrite.All` (if both reading and writing are needed)
  - `User.Read.All`
  - `Directory.Read.All`
  1. [Create an Entra ID app registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app?pivots=portal).
  2. [Add Graph access permissions to an app registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/howto-update-permissions?pivots=portal#add-permissions-to-an-application).
  3. [Grant consent for the added Graph permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/howto-update-permissions?pivots=portal#grant-consent-for-the-added-permissions-for-the-enterprise-application).
