  OneDrive personal accounts, and Microsoft 365 Free, Basic, Personal, and Family plans are not supported.
- A SharePoint Online plan, or a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 Business or enterprise plan that includes SharePoint Online. 
  (Even if you only plan to use OneDrive, you still need a plan that includes SharePoint Online, because OneDrive is built on SharePoint technology.)

- Two types of authentication are supported: client credentials, and a username and password. Both authentication types require a Microsoft Entra ID app registration. 

  <Note>
      The OneDrive connector does not support any other authentication methods, such as multifactor (MFA) or passwordless authentication.
  </Note>

  You will need to provide the **Application (client) ID**, **Directory (tenant) ID**, and **Client secret** for the Entra ID app registration that has access to the target OneDrive account, and 
  the app registration must have the correct set of Microsoft Graph access permissions. These permissions include:

  - `Files.ReadWrite.All` (if both reading and writing are needed)
  - `Sites.ReadWrite.All` (if both reading and writing are needed)
  - `User.Read.All`
  - `Directory.Read.All`

  1. [Create an Entra ID app registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app?pivots=portal).
  2. [Add Graph access permissions to an app registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/howto-update-permissions?pivots=portal#add-permissions-to-an-application).
  3. [Grant consent for the added Graph permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/howto-update-permissions?pivots=portal#grant-consent-for-the-added-permissions-for-the-enterprise-application).

- Both authentication types also require the User Principal Name (UPN) for the OneDrive account. This is typically the OneDrive account user's email address. To find a UPN:

  1. Depending on your plan, sign in to your Microsoft 365 admin center (typically [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)) using your administrator credentials, 
     or sign in to your Office 365 portal (typically [https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com)) using your credentials.
  2. In the **Users** section, click **Active users**.
  3. Locate the user account in the list of active users.
  4. The UPN is displayed in the **Username** column.

  The following video shows how to get a UPN:

- For username and password authentication, you will also need the password for the target UPN.
