Fill in the following fields:

- **Name** (_required_): A unique name for this connector.
- **Collection Name**: The name of the collection in the keyspace. If no value is provided, see the beginning of this article for the behavior at run time.
- **Keyspace** (_required_): The name of the keyspace in the collection.
- **Batch Size**: The maximum number of records per batch. The default is `20` if not otherwise specified.
- **Flatten Metadata**: Check this box to flatten the metadata into each record. 
  Specifically, when flattened, the metadata key values are 
  brought to the top level of the element, and the `metadata` key itself is removed. By default, the metadata is not flattened.
- **Binary Encode Vectors**: Uncheck this box to upload vectors as a list of numbers. By default, vectors are uploaded as binary. This is more efficient, but it makes it harder to view and work with vectors in the UI.
- **Enable Lexical Search**: Check this box to enable lexical and hybrid search. When enabled, document text will be inserted into the `$lexical` field. **Important**: Your collection must be configured for lexical search, and your database must be in one of the supported AWS regions. See the [Astra DB documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/databases/lexical-search.html) for more information. By default, lexical search is disabled.
- **Astra DB Generated Embeddings**: Check this box to use an Astra vectorize integration for embeddings. When enabled, document text will be inserted into the `$vectorize` field, and Astra DB will automatically populate the `$vector` field with embeddings. **Important**: Your workflow must not include an embedder node, and you must have an embedding provider configured for your collection. When disabled (the default), Unstructured will insert embeddings directly into the `$vector` field, and your workflow must include an embedder node. See the [Astra DB documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/databases/embedding-generation.html) for more information. By default, Astra-generated embeddings are disabled.
- **API Endpoint** (_required_): The database's associated API endpoint.
- **Token** (_required_): The application token for the database.
