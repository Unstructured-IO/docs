To use the AWS CloudFormation console to create an Amazon S3 bucket that allows all authenticated AWS IAM users 
in the corresponding AWS account to read and write to the bucket, do the following. 

<Info>Your organization might have stricter bucket policy requirements. Check with your AWS account 
  administrator if you are unsure.</Info>

1. Save the following YAML to a file on your local machine, for example `create-s3-bucket.yaml`. To change 
   the following bucket policy to restrict it to a specific user in the AWS account, change `root` to that 
   specific username.

   ```yaml

           BlockPublicPolicy: false
           IgnorePublicAcls: true

                 - 's3:ListBucket'
                 - 's3:DeleteObject'
               Resource:
