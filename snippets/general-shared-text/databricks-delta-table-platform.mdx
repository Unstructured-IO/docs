Fill in the following fields:

- **Name** (_required_): A unique name for this connector.
- **Server Hostname** (_required_): The target Databricks cluster's or SQL warehouse's **Server Hostname** value.
- **HTTP Path** (_required_): The cluster's or SQL warehouse's **HTTP Path** value.
- **Token** (_required_ for PAT authentication): For Databricks personal access token (PAT) authentication, the target Databricks user's PAT value.
- **UUID** and **OAuth Secret** (_required_ for OAuth authentication): For Databricks OAuth machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication, the Databricks managed service principal's **UUID** (or **Client ID** or **Application ID**) and OAuth **Secret** (client secret) values. 
- **Catalog** (_required_): The name of the catalog in Unity Catalog for the target volume and table in the Databricks workspace.
- **Database**: The name of the schema (formerly known as a database) in Unity Catalog for the target table. The default is `default` if not otherwise specified.

  If the target table and volume are in the same schema (formerly known as a database), then **Database** and **Schema** will have the same names.

- **Table Name**: The name of the target table in Unity Catalog.

  - If a table name is specified, but a table with that name does not exist within the specified schema (formerly known as a database), the connector attempts to create a table with that name within that schema. 
  - If no table name is specified, the connector attempts to create a table named `u<short-workflow-id>` within the specified schema (formerly known as a database).

  See the beginning of this article for additional technical requirements before having the connector attempt to create a table.

- **Schema**: The name of the schema (formerly known as a database) in Unity Catalog for the target volume. The default is `default` if not otherwise specified.

  If the target volume and table are in the same schema (formerly known as a database), then **Schema** and **Database** will have the same names.

- **Volume** (_required_): The name of the target volume in Unity Catalog.
- **Volume Path**: Any target folder path inside of the volume to use instead of the volume's root. If not otherwise specified, processing occurs at the volume's root.

<Note>
    Using dashes (`-`) in the names of catalogs, schemas (formerly known as databases), tables, and volumes might cause isolated issues with the connector. It is 
    recommended to use underscores (`_`) instead of dashes in the names of catalogs, schemas, tables, and volumes.
