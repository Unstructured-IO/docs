- An OpenSearch instance, such as an [AWS OpenSearch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/setting-up.html) instance...

  ...or a [local](https://opensearch.org/downloads.html) instance.

  In all cases, the [OpenSearch version](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-py/blob/main/COMPATIBILITY.md) must be compatible with the client version of the [opensearch-py](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-py/blob/main/COMPATIBILITY.md) package on PyPI. 

- The instance's hostname and port number. To learn how, see:

  - [Creating and managing Amazon OpenSearch Service domains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/createupdatedomains.html) for AWS OpenSearch instances.
  - [Communicate with OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/getting-started/communicate/) for local OpenSearch instances.

- The name of the search index on the instance. [Create an index](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/index-apis/create-index/).

  The OpenSearch index that you use must have a schema that is compatible with the schema of the documents 
  that Unstructured produces for you. Unstructured cannot provide a schema that is guaranteed to work in all 
  circumstances. This is because these schemas will vary based on your source files' types; how you 
  want Unstructured to partition, chunk, and generate embeddings; any custom post-processing code that you run; and other factors. 

  You can adapt the following index schema example for your own needs:

  ```json
  {
      "settings": {
          "index": {
              "knn": true,
              "knn.algo_param.ef_search": 100
          }
      },
      "mappings": {
          "properties": {
              "record_id": {
                  "type": "text"
              },
              "element_id": {
                  "type": "keyword"
              },
              "text": {
                  "type": "text"
              },
              "embeddings": {
                  "type": "knn_vector",
                  "dimension": 384
              },
              "metadata": {
                  "type": "object",
                  "properties": {
                      "parent_id": {
                          "type": "text"
                      },
                      "page_number": {
                          "type": "integer"
                      },
                      "is_continuation": {
                         "type": "boolean"
                      },
                      "orig_elements": {
                         "type": "text"
                      },
                      "partitioner_type": {
                         "type": "text"
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- If you're using basic authentication to the instance, the user's name and password.
- If you're using certificates for authentication instead:

  - The path to the Certificate Authority (CA) bundle, if you use intermediate CAs with your root CA.
  - The path to the combined private key and certificate file, or
  - The paths to the separate private key and certificate file.
