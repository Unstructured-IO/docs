The OpenSearch prerequisites:

- An OpenSearch instance, such as an [AWS OpenSearch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/setting-up.html) instance...

  In all cases, the [OpenSearch version](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-py/blob/main/COMPATIBILITY.md) must be compatible with the client version of the [opensearch-py](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-py/blob/main/COMPATIBILITY.md) package on PyPI. 

- The instance's hostname and port number.
- The name of the search index on the instance.
- If you're using basic authentication to the instance, the user's name and password.
- If you're using certificates for authentication instead:

  - The path to the Certificate Authority (CA) bundle, if you use intermediate CAs with your root CA.
  - The path to the combined private key and certificate file, or
  - The paths to the separate private key and certificate file.
