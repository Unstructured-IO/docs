- A SQLite instance. [Download and install SQLite](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/).

- The path to the database's `.db` file.
- A table in the database. [Create a table](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html).

  The table's schema must match the schema of the documents that Unstructured produces. 
  Unstructured cannot provide a schema that is guaranteed to work in all 
  circumstances. This is because these schemas will vary based on your source files' types; how you 
  want Unstructured to partition, chunk, and generate embeddings; any custom post-processing code that you run; and other factors. 
  
  You can adapt the following table schema example for your own needs:
  
  ```sql SQLite
  CREATE TABLE elements (
      id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
      element_id TEXT,
      text TEXT,
      embeddings TEXT,
      parent_id TEXT,
      page_number INTEGER,
      is_continuation INTEGER,
      orig_elements TEXT
  );
  ```
