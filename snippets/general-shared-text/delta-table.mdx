The preceding video does not show how to create an AWS account or an S3 bucket. 

For more information about prerequisites, see the following:

- An S3 bucket. [Create an S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html). 
  Additional approaches are in the following video and in the how-to sections at the end of this page.

- For authenticated bucket read access, the authenticated AWS IAM user must have at minimum the permissions of `s3:ListBucket` and `s3:GetObject` for that bucket. [Learn how](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-policies-s3.html).

- For bucket write access, authenticated access to the bucket must be enabled (anonymous access must not be enabled), and the authenticated AWS IAM user must have at 
  minimum the permission of `s3:PutObject` for that bucket. [Learn how](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-policies-s3.html).

- For authenticated access, an AWS access key and secret access key for the authenticated AWS IAM user in the account. 
  [Create an AWS access key and secret access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey).

- If the target files are in the root of the bucket, the path to the bucket, formatted as `protocol://bucket/` (for example, `s3://my-bucket/`). 
  If the target files are in a folder, the path to the target folder in the S3 bucket, formatted as `protocol://bucket/path/to/folder/` (for example, `s3://my-bucket/my-folder/`). 
- If the target files are in a folder, make sure the authenticated AWS IAM user has 
  authenticated access to the folder as well. [Enable authenticated folder access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-folders).

## Add an access policy to an existing bucket

import S3BucketPolicy from '/snippets/general-shared-text/s3-bucket-policy.mdx';

<S3BucketPolicy />

## Create a bucket with AWS CloudFormation

import S3BucketCloudFormation from '/snippets/general-shared-text/s3-cf-setup.mdx';

<S3BucketCloudFormation />

## Create a bucket with the AWS CLI

import S3BucketCLI from '/snippets/general-shared-text/s3-cli-setup.mdx';

<S3BucketCLI />
