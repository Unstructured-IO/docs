The Delta Table prerequisites:

- The path to the Delta Table:

  - For AWS, this path takes the format `s3://<bucket-name>/<path-to-table>`
  - For Azure, this path takes the format `abfss://<container-name>@<storage-account-name>.dfs.core.windows.net/<path-to-table>`
  - For GCP, this path takes the format `gs://<bucket-name>/<path-to-table>`

  A few ways to get this path include:

  - Running the Databricks SQL statement `SHOW CREATE TABLE <table-name>;`. Look for the `Location` field in the output. 
    This field will contain the path to the Delta Table specified by `<table-name>`.
  - Running the Databricks SQL statement `SHOW CREATE TABLE <table-name>`;. This will display the `CREATE TABLE` statement, 
    which will include the `LOCATION` clause. This clause will contain the path to the Delta Table specified by `<table-name>`.
  - Running the following PySpark code in a Databricks notebook. This will print the path to the Delta Table specified by `<table-name>`.

    ```python
    deltaTable = DeltaTable.forName(spark, "<table-name>")
    location = deltaTable.location()
    print(location)
    ```

- The storage options to access the Delta Table:

  - For AWS, this is the AWS access key ID and its corresponding AWS secret access key, which have access to the backing Amazon S3 bucket.
  - For Azure, this is the [SAS token (recommended)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/translator/document-translation/how-to-guides/create-sas-tokens), 
    [access key](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage#view-account-access-keys), or 
    [connection string](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-configure-connection-string#configure-a-connection-string-for-an-azure-storage-account) 
    for the backing Azure Storage account.
  - For GCP, this is the JSON content of a Google Cloud service account key that has the necessary permissions to access the specified Google Cloud bucket. The service account key must have at least the **Storage Object Viewer** role to ensure proper access permissions.
