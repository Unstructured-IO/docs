<Tip>
    If **Save and Test** shows a connection failure message, it appears for only a few seconds. To see the failure message again, do the following:

    1. Close the **New Connector** settings page by clicking the close (**X**) button in the upper corner.
    2. With **Connectors** already selected in the sidebar, click the failed connector in the list of **Sources** or **Destinations**. The failure message reappears.

    To change the connector's original settings and try again, click the pencil (edit) button in the upper corner, and then follow the on-screen directions.

    To delete the connector and start over from the beginning, click the ellipsis (three dots) button in the upper corner, and then click **Delete Connector > Continue**. 
    You can then create a new connector by clicking **New**. The new connector can have the same name as the deleted connector or a different name altogether.
