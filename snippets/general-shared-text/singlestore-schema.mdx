The table's schema must match the schema of the documents that Unstructured produces. 

During insertion, JSON objects are flattened, and underscores are placed between nested object names. 
For example, the following JSON object matches a column in the table named `data_source_date_created`:

```json
{
    "...": "...",
    "data_source": {
        "date_created": "1719963233.949"
    },
    "...": "..."
}
```

The `metadata` object itself is also flattened in a similar way. However, for nested objects in `metadata`, 
the column in the table does not start with `metadata_`. For example, the following JSON object matches a 
column in the table named `last_modified`:

```json
{
    "...": "...",
    "metadata": {
        "...": "...",
        "last_modified": "2022-12-16T17:04:16-05:00",
        "...": "..."
    },
    "...": "..."
}
```

Unstructured cannot provide a table schema that is guaranteed to work in all 
circumstances. This is because these schemas will vary based on your source files' types; how you 
want Unstructured to partition, chunk, and generate embeddings; any custom post-processing code that you run; and other factors.

You can adapt the following table schema example for your own needs:

```sql
CREATE TABLE elements (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    record_id TEXT,
    element_id TEXT,
    text TEXT,
    embeddings Vector(384),
    parent_id TEXT,
    page_number TEXT,
    is_continuation BOOLEAN,
    orig_elements TEXT
);
```
