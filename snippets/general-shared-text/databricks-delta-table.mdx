  ```

  <Info>
      In Databricks, a table's _schema_ is different than a _schema_ (formerly known as a database) in a catalog-schema object relationship in Unity Catalog.
  </Info>

- Within Unity Catalog, a volume 
  for [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/volumes/utility-commands.html), 
  [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/volumes/utility-commands), 
  or [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/volumes/utility-commands.html)
  within the same schema (formerly known as a database) as the table. 

  The following video shows how to create a catalog, schema (formerly known as a database), and a volume in Unity Catalog, and set privileges for someone other than their owner to use them:

  <Note>
      If you already have a table that you want to use, then use the table's existing catalog and schema (formerly known as a database). Do not create a new catalog or schema (formerly known as a database)&mdash;just create the new volume. The volume and table must be within the same schema (formerly known as a database) and catalog.
  </Note>

- For Databricks managed service principal authentication (using Databricks OAuth M2M) to the workspace:

  - A Databricks managed service principal. 
    This service principal must have the appropriate access permissions to the catalog, schema (formerly known as a database), table, volume, and cluster or SQL warehouse.
  - The service principal's **UUID** (or **Client ID** or **Application ID**) value.
  - The OAuth **Secret** value for the service principal. 

  To get this information, see Steps 1-3 of the instructions for [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m.html), 
  [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m), or 
  [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m.html).

  <Note>
      For Azure Databricks, this connector only supports Databricks managed service principals for authentication. 
      Microsoft Entra ID managed service principals are not supported.
  </Note>

  The following video shows how to create a Databricks managed service principal:

- For Databricks personal access token authentication to the workspace, the 
  Databricks personal access token value for 
  [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth/pat.html#databricks-personal-access-tokens-for-workspace-users), 
  [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/dev-tools/auth/pat#azure-databricks-personal-access-tokens-for-workspace-users), or 
  [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth/pat.html#databricks-personal-access-tokens-for-workspace-users). 
  This token must be for the workspace user who 
  has the appropriate access permissions to the catalog, schema (formerly known as a database), table, volume, and cluster or SQL warehouse, 

  The following video shows how to create a Databricks personal access token:

- The Databricks workspace user or Databricks managed service principal must have the following _minimum_ set of permissions and privileges to write to an 
  existing volume or table in Unity Catalog:

  - To use an all-purpose cluster for access, `Can Restart` permission on that cluster. Learn how to check and set cluster permissions for 
    [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/compute/clusters-manage.html#compute-permissions), 
    [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/compute/clusters-manage#cluster-level-permissions), or 
    [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/compute/clusters-manage.html#compute-permissions).
  - To use a SQL warehouse for access, `Can use` permission on that SQL warehouse. Learn how to check and set SQL warehouse permissions for 
    [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/compute/sql-warehouse/create.html#manage-a-sql-warehouse), 
    [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/compute/sql-warehouse/create#manage), or 
    [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/compute/sql-warehouse/create.html#manage-a-sql-warehouse).
  - To access a Unity Catalog volume, the following privileges:

    - `USE CATALOG` on the volume's parent catalog in Unity Catalog.
    - `USE SCHEMA` on the volume's parent schema (formerly known as a database) in Unity Catalog.
    - `READ VOLUME` and `WRITE VOLUME` on the volume.

    [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/index.html#show-grant-and-revoke-privileges).

  - To access a Unity Catalog table, the following privileges:

    - `USE CATALOG` on the table's parent catalog in Unity Catalog.
    - `USE SCHEMA` on the tables's parent schema (formerly known as a database) in Unity Catalog.
    - `MODIFY` and `SELECT` on the table.
