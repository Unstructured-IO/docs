  [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/integrations/compute-details), or 
  [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/integrations/compute-details.html).
- Unity Catalog enabled in the workspace for [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/get-started.html),
  [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/data-governance/unity-catalog/get-started), or 
  [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/get-started.html). 
- Within Unity Catalog:

  - A catalog 
    for [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/catalogs/create-catalog.html), 
    [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/catalogs/create-catalog), or 
    [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/catalogs/create-catalog.html). 
  - A schema (formerly known as a database) 
    for [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/schemas/create-schema.html), 
    [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/schemas/create-schema), or 
    [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/schemas/create-schema.html)
    within that catalog, 
  - A table 
    for [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/tables/managed.html), 
    [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/tables/managed), or 
    [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/tables/managed.html)
    within that schema (formerly known as a database).

    You can have the connector attempt to create a table for you automatically at run time. To do this, in the connector settings as described later in this article, 
    do one of the following:
    
    - Specify the name of the table that you want the connector to attempt to create within the specified catalog and schema (formerly known as a database).
    - Leave the table name blank. The connector will attempt to create a table within the specified catalog and schema (formerly known as a database). 
      For the [Unstructured UI](/ui/overview) and [Unstructured API](/api-reference/overview), the table is named `u<short-workflow-id>`. 
      For the [Unstructured Ingest CLI and Ingest Python library](/open-source/ingestion/overview), the table is named `unstructuredautocreated`.

    The connector will attempt to create the table on behalf of the related Databricks workspace user or Databricks managed service principal that is referenced in the connector settings, as described later in these requirements. 
    If successful, the table's owner is set as the related Databricks workspace user or Databricks managed service principal. The owner will have all Unity Catalog 
    privileges on the table by default. No other Databricks workspace users or Databricks managed service principals will have any privileges on the table by default.

    <Warning>
        If the table's parent schema (formerly known as a database) is not owned by the same Databricks workspace user or Databricks managed service principal that is 
        referenced in the connector settings, then you should grant the new table's owner the `CREATE TABLE` privilege on that parent schema (formerly known as a database) 
        before the connector attempts to create the table. Otherwise, table creation could fail.
    </Warning>

    <Note>
        Using dashes (`-`) in the names of catalogs, schemas (formerly known as databases), and tables might cause isolated issues with the connector. It is 
        recommended to use underscores (`_`) instead of dashes in the names of catalogs, schemas, and tables.
    </Note>

  The following video shows how to create a catalog, schema (formerly known as a database), and a table in Unity Catalog if you do not already have them available, and set privileges for someone other than their owner to use them:

  allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>

  If you want to use an existing table or create one yourself beforehand, this table must contain at minimum the following column names and their data types:

  ```text
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS <catalog_name>.<schema_name>.<table_name> (
      id STRING NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
      record_id STRING NOT NULL,
      element_id STRING NOT NULL,
      text STRING,
      embeddings ARRAY<FLOAT>,
      type STRING,
      metadata VARIANT
  );
  ```

  <Info>
      In Databricks, a table's _schema_ is different than a _schema_ (formerly known as a database) in a catalog-schema object relationship in Unity Catalog.
  </Info>

- Within Unity Catalog, a volume 
  for [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/volumes/utility-commands.html), 
  [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/volumes/utility-commands), 
  or [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/volumes/utility-commands.html). The volume can be in the same 
  schema (formerly known as a database) as the table, or the volume and table can be in separate schemas. In either case, both of these 
  schemas must share the same parent catalog.

  <Note>
      Using dashes (`-`) in the names of volumes might cause isolated issues with the connector. It is 
      recommended to use underscores (`_`) instead of dashes in the names of volumes.
  </Note>

  The following video shows how to create a catalog, schema (formerly known as a database), and a volume in Unity Catalog if you do not already have them available, and set privileges for someone other than their owner to use them:

- For Databricks managed service principal authentication (using Databricks OAuth M2M) to the workspace:

  - A Databricks managed service principal. 
    This service principal must have the appropriate access permissions to the catalog, schema (formerly known as a database), table, volume, and cluster or SQL warehouse.
  - The service principal's **UUID** (or **Client ID** or **Application ID**) value.
  - The OAuth **Secret** value for the service principal. 

  To get this information, see Steps 1-3 of the instructions for [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m.html), 
  [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m), or 
  [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m.html).

  <Note>
      For Azure Databricks, this connector only supports Databricks managed service principals for authentication. 
      Microsoft Entra ID managed service principals are not supported.
  </Note>

  The following video shows how to create a Databricks managed service principal if you do not already have one available:

- For Databricks personal access token authentication to the workspace, the 
  Databricks personal access token value for 
  [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth/pat.html#databricks-personal-access-tokens-for-workspace-users), 
  [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/dev-tools/auth/pat#azure-databricks-personal-access-tokens-for-workspace-users), or 
  [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth/pat.html#databricks-personal-access-tokens-for-workspace-users). 
  This token must be for the workspace user who 
  has the appropriate access permissions to the catalog, schema (formerly known as a database), table, volume, and cluster or SQL warehouse, 

  The following video shows how to create a Databricks personal access token if you do not already have one available:

- The Databricks workspace user or Databricks managed service principal must have the following _minimum_ set of permissions and privileges to write to an 
  existing volume or table in Unity Catalog. If the owner of these is that Databricks workspace user or Databricks managed service principal, then 
  they will have all necessary permissions and privileges by default. If the owner is someone else, then the following permissions and privileges must be 
  explicitly granted to them before using the connector:

  - To use an all-purpose cluster for access, `Can Restart` permission on that cluster. Learn how to check and set cluster permissions for 
    [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/compute/clusters-manage.html#compute-permissions), 
    [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/compute/clusters-manage#cluster-level-permissions), or 
    [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/compute/clusters-manage.html#compute-permissions).
  - To use a SQL warehouse for access, `Can use` permission on that SQL warehouse. Learn how to check and set SQL warehouse permissions for 
    [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/compute/sql-warehouse/create.html#manage-a-sql-warehouse),

    [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/index.html#show-grant-and-revoke-privileges).

  - To access a Unity Catalog table, the following privileges:

    - `USE CATALOG` on the table's parent catalog in Unity Catalog.
    - `USE SCHEMA` on the tables's parent schema (formerly known as a database) in Unity Catalog.
    - To create a new table, `CREATE TABLE` on the table's parent schema (formerly known as a database) in Unity Catalog.
