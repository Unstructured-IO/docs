<Note>
    If you signed up for Unstructured through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page, or if you are using a [self-hosted](/self-hosted/overview) deployment of Unstructured, the following sign up information 
    does not apply to you, and you can skip ahead to the next step after you sign in. If you are not sure how to sign in, contact Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).

Go to [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io) and use your email address, Google account, or GitHub account to 
sign up for an Unstructured account (if you do not already have one) and sign into the account at the same time. The 
[Unstructured user interface (UI)](/ui/overview) appears, and you can start using it right away.
