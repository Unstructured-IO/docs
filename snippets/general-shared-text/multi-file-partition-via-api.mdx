<Note>The `partition_via_api` function in the open source library processes single files only. To process multiple files at a time, use the [Unstructured Ingest CLI](/open-source/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-cli) or the [Unstructured Ingest Python library](/open-source/ingestion/python-ingest) with their provided [source connectors](/open-source/ingestion/source-connectors/overview) and [destination connectors](/open-source/ingestion/destination-connectors/overview).</Note>
