<Note>The `partition_via_api` function in the open source library processes single files only. To process multiple files at a time, use the Unstructured CLI or the open source library with their provided [source connectors](/open-source/ingest/source-connectors/overview) and [destination connectors](/open-source/ingest/destination-connectors/overview).</Note>
