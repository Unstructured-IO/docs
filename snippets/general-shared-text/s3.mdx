The preceding video does not show how to create an AWS account; enable anonymous access to the bucket (which is supported but 
not recommended); or generate an AWS STS session token for temporary access, if required by your organization's security 
requirements. For more information about requirements, see the following:

- An AWS account. [Create an AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free).

- An S3 bucket. [Create an S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html). 
  Additional approaches are in the following video and in the how-to sections at the end of this page.

- Anonymous (supported but not recommended) or authenticated access to the bucket. 

  - [Enable anonymous bucket access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-anonymous-user).

  - [Enable authenticated bucket access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/walkthrough1.html).

    ![Enable authenticated bucket access](/img/connectors/s3-auth-access.gif)

- For authenticated bucket read access, the authenticated AWS IAM user must have at minimum the permissions of `s3:ListBucket` and `s3:GetObject` for that bucket. [Learn how](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-policies-s3.html).

- For bucket write access, authenticated access to the bucket must be enabled (anonymous access must not be enabled), and the authenticated AWS IAM user must have at 
  minimum the permission of `s3:PutObject` for that bucket. [Learn how](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-policies-s3.html).

- For authenticated access, an AWS access key and secret access key for the authenticated AWS IAM user in the account. 
  [Create an AWS access key and secret access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey).

- For authenticated access in untrusted environments or enhanced security scenarios, an AWS STS session token for temporary access, in addition to an AWS access key and secret access key. [Create a session token](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_getsessiontoken).

  <Warning>
      AWS STS credentials can be valid for as little as 15 minutes or as long as 36 hours, depending on how the credentials were initially 
      generated. After the expiry time, the credentials are no longer valid will no longer work with the corresponding S3 connector. 
      You must get a new set of credentials to replace the expired ones by calling 
      [GetSessionToken](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetSessionToken.html) in the AWS STS API. 
      To overwrite the expired credentials with the new set:
    
      - For the Unstructured user interface (UI), manually update the AWS Key, AWS Secret Key, and STS Token fields in the Unstructured UI 
        for the corresponding S3 [source](/ui/sources/s3) or [destination](/ui/destinations/s3) connector.
      - For the Unstructured API, use the Unstructured Workflow Endpoint to call the 
        [update source](/api-reference/workflow/overview#update-a-source-connector) or 
        [update destination](/api-reference/workflow/overview#update-a-destination-connector) connector operation 
        for the corresponding S3 [source](/api-reference/workflow/sources/s3) or 
        [destination](/api-reference/workflow/destinations/s3) connector.
      - For Unstructured Ingest, change the values of `--key`, `--secret`, and `--token` (CLI) or `key`, `secret`, and `token` (Python) in your command or code for the 
        corresponding S3 [source](/open-source/ingestion/source-connectors/s3) or [destination](/open-source/ingestion/destination-connectors/s3) connector.

  </Warning>
  
- If the target files are in the root of the bucket, the path to the bucket, formatted as `protocol://bucket/` (for example, `s3://my-bucket/`). 
  If the target files are in a folder, the path to the target folder in the S3 bucket, formatted as `protocol://bucket/path/to/folder/` (for example, `s3://my-bucket/my-folder/`). 
- If the target files are in a folder, and authenticated bucket access is enabled, make sure the authenticated AWS IAM user has 
  authenticated access to the folder as well. [Enable authenticated folder access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-folders).
