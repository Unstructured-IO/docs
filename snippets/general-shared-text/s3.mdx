- Anonymous or authenticated access to the bucket. 

  - [Enable anonymous bucket access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-anonymous-user).

  - [Enable authenticated bucket access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/walkthrough1.html).

    ![Enable authenticated bucket access](/img/connectors/s3-auth-access.gif)

- For authenticated bucket read access, the authenticated AWS IAM user must have at minimum the permissions of `s3:ListBucket` and `s3:GetObject` for that bucket. [Learn how](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-policies-s3.html).

- For bucket write access, authenticated access to the bucket must be enabled (anonymous access must not be enabled), and the authenticated AWS IAM user must have at 
  minimum the permission of `s3:PutObject` for that bucket. [Learn how](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-policies-s3.html).

- For authenticated access, an AWS access key and secret access key for the authenticated AWS IAM user in the account. 
  [Create an AWS access key and secret access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey).

- For authenticated access in untrusted environments or enhanced security scenarios, an AWS STS session token for temporary access, in addition to an AWS access key and secret access key. [Create a session token](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_getsessiontoken).

- If the target files are in the root of the bucket, the path to the bucket, formatted as `protocol://bucket/` (for example, `s3://my-bucket/`). 
  If the target files are in a folder, the path to the target folder in the S3 bucket, formatted as `protocol://bucket/path/to/folder/` (for example, `s3://my-bucket/my-folder/`). 
- If the target files are in a folder, and authenticated bucket access is enabled, make sure the authenticated AWS IAM user has 
  authenticated access to the folder as well. [Enable authenticated folder access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-folders).
