The S3 connector dependencies:

```bash CLI, Python
pip install "unstructured[s3]"
```

These environment variables:

- `AWS_S3_URL` - The S3 remote URL, formatted as `protocol://dir/path/` (for example, `s3://my-bucket/my-folder/`).
- If your S3 bucket doesn't allow anonymous access, provide your AWS credentials:

- `--key` (CLI) or `key` (Python) - The AWS access key ID, represented as `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`.
- `--secret` (CLI) or `secret` (Python) - Your AWS secret access key, represented as `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

If your S3 bucket allows access without local AWS credentials, set `--anonymous` (CLI) or `anonymous=True` (Python) instead.
