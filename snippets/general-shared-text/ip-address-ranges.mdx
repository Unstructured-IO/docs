To call Unstructured-hosted services, allow Unstructured's IP address ranges. 
To get these address ranges, go to 
[https://assets.p6m.u10d.net/publicitems/ip-prefixes.json](https://assets.p6m.u10d.net/publicitems/ip-prefixes.json) 
and allow all of the `ip_prefix` fields' values that are listed. Each address range uses the 
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) format of `N.N.N.N/N`, where each 
of these letters represents a number from one to three digits, for example `192.0.2.0/30`.
