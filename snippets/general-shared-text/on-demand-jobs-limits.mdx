<Note>
    Each on-demand job is limited to 10 files, and each file is limited to 10 MB in size.

    If you need to launch a series of on-demand jobs in rapid succession, you must wait at least once second between launch 
    requests. Otherwise, you will receive a rate limit error.

    A maximum of 5 on-demand jobs can be running in your Unstructured account. If you launch a new on-demand job 
    but 5 existing on-demand jobs are still running, the new on-demand job will remain in a scheduled state until one of the 5 
    existing on-demand jobs is done running.
