The MongoDB requirements for a MongoDB Atlas deployment include:

import AllowIPAddressRanges from '/snippets/general-shared-text/ip-address-ranges.mdx';
import MongoDBRecordID from '/snippets/general-shared-text/mongodb-record-id.mdx';

<Warning>
    For MongoDB Atlas, SCRAM-SHA-1 is not supported for authentication. This means that cluster types that only 
    include SCRAM-SHA-1, such as **Free**, **M0**, **Flex**, and **Serverless**, are **not** supported. 
    Unstructured only supports SCRAM-SHA-256 for MongoDB Atlas, which is cryptographically stronger than SCRAM-SHA-1. 

    If you try to test or use a connector that refers to a cluster type that only includes SCRAM-SHA-1, the 
    operation will fail, and you will get an error message similar to the following: 
    `[digital envelope routines] unsupported`.
</Warning>

- A MongoDB Atlas account. [Create an account](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register).
- A MongoDB Atlas cluster. [Create a cluster](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/create-new-cluster/). Be sure to **not** 
  select a cluster type that only includes SCRAM-SHA-1, such as **Free**, **M0**, **Flex**, or **Serverless**.
- The cluster must be reachable from your application environment, for example by adding IP addresses to your IP access list. [Learn more](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/setup-cluster-security/#network-and-firewall-requirements). 
- The cluster must be configured to allow IP address. [Learn how](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/ip-access-list/#add-ip-access-list-entries).

  <AllowIPAddressRanges />

- The cluster must have at least one database. [Create a database](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/databases/#create-a-database).
- The database must have at least one user, and that user must have sufficient access to the database. [Create a database user](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security-add-mongodb-users/#add-database-users). [Give the user database access](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/authorization/).
- The database must have at least one collection. [Create a collection](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/collections/#create-a-collection).

  <MongoDBRecordID />

- The connection string for the cluster. For MongoDB Atlas, this connection string must include the protocol, username, password, host, and cluster name. For example:

  ```text
  mongodb+srv://<db_user>:<db_password>@<host>/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=<cluster>
  ```

  To get the connection string in MongoDB Atlas, do the following:

  1. Log in to your MongoDB Atlas console.
  2. In the sidebar, under **Databases**, click **Clusters**.
  3. Click on the cluster you want to connect to.
  4. Click **Connect**.
  5. Click **Drivers**.
  6. Under **Add your connection string into your application code**, copy the connection string. 
     You can then close the **Connect** dialog in MongoDB Atlas.

     Before you use this connection string, be sure to fill in any placeholders in the string, such as your MongoDB Atlas database user's password value.
