<Warning>
    Unstructured can potentially generate table-to-HTML output only for workflows that are configured as follows:
    
    - With a **Partitioner** node set to use the **Auto** or **High Res** partitioning strategy, and a table-to-HTML output node is added.  
    - With a **Partitioner** node set to use the **VLM** partitioning strategy. No table-to-HTML output node is needed (or allowed).

    Even with these configurations, Unstructured actually generates table-to-HTML output only for files that contain tables and are also eligible 
    for processing with the following partitioning strategies:
    
    - **High Res**, when the workflow's **Partitioner** node is set to use **Auto** or **High Res**.
    - **VLM** or **High Res**, when the workflow's **Partitioner** node is set to use **VLM**.
    
    Unstructured never generates table-to-HTML output for workflows that are configured as follows:
    
    - With a **Partitioner** node set to use the **Fast** partitioning strategy.
    - With a **Partitioner** node set to use the **Auto**, **High Res**, or **VLM** partitioning strategy, for all files that Unstructured encounters that do not contain tables.
