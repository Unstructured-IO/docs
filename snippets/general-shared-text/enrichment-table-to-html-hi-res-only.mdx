<Warning>
    Table-to-HTML generation happens only when the **Partitioner** node in a workflow is set to use the **High Res** [partitioning strategy](/ui/partitioning) and 
    the workflow also contains a table-to-HTML enrichment node.

    Setting the **Partitioner** node to use **Auto**, **VLM**, or **Fast** in a workflow that also contains a table-to-HTML enrichment node 
    will not generate any table-to-HTML output, and it could also cause the workflow to stop running or produce unexpected results.
</Warning>
