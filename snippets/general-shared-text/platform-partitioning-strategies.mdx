Unstructured recommends that you choose the **Auto** partitioning strategy in most cases. With **Auto**, Unstructured does all 
the heavy lifting, optimizing at runtime for the highest quality at the lowest cost page-by-page.

You should consider the following additional strategies only if you are absolutely sure that your documents are of the same 
type. Each of the following strategies are best suited for specific situations. Choosing one of these 
strategies other than **Auto** for sets of documents of different types could produce undesirable results, 
including reduction in transformation quality.

- **VLM**: For the highest-quality transformation of these file types: `.bmp`, `.gif`, `.heic`, `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`, `.png`, `.tiff`, and `.webp`.
- **High Res**: For all other [supported file types](/ui/supported-file-types), and for the generation of bounding box coordinates.
- **Fast**: For text-only documents.
