Unstructured recommends that you choose the **Auto** partitioning strategy in most cases. With **Auto**, Unstructured does all 
the heavy lifting, optimizing at runtime for the highest quality at the lowest cost page-by-page.

You should consider the following three additional strategies only if you are absolutely sure that your documents are of the same 
composition and complexity. Each of the following strategies are best suited for specific situations. Choosing one of these 
three strategies other than **Auto** for sets of documents of different types could produce undesirable results, 
including reduction in transformation quality.

- **VLM**: Provides the most consistent transformation quality, especially for complex documents.
- **High Res**: Built for documents with medium to low complexity (for example, simple images and tables). 
  This strategy is less costly and speedier than **VLM**.
- **Fast**: Built for text-only documents with no complexity. This is the cheapest and fastest strategy.
