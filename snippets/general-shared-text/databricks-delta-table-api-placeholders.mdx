- `<name>` (_required_) - A unique name for this connector.
- `<server-hostname>` (_required_): The target Databricks cluster's or SQL warehouse's **Server Hostname** value.
- `<http-path>` (_required_): The cluster's or SQL warehouse's **HTTP Path** value.
- `<token>` (_required_ for PAT authentication): For Databricks personal access token (PAT) authentication, the target Databricks user's PAT value.
- `<client-id>` and `<client-secret>` (_required_ for OAuth authentication): For Databricks OAuth machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication, the Databricks managed service principal's **UUID** (or **Client ID** or **Application ID**) and OAuth **Secret** (client secret) values. 
- `<catalog>` (_required_): The name of the catalog in Unity Catalog for the target volume and table in the Databricks workspace.
- `<database>`: The name of the schema (formerly known as a database) in Unity Catalog for the target table. The default is `default` if not otherwise specified.

  If the target table and volume are in the same schema (formerly known as a database), then `<database>` and `<schema>` will have the same values.

- `<table_name>`: The name of the target table in Unity Catalog.

  - If a table name is specified, but a table with that name does not exist within the specified schema (formerly known as a database), the connector attempts to create a table with that name within that schema. 
  - If no table name is specified, the connector attempts to create a table named `unstructuredautocreated` within the specified schema (formerly known as a database).

  See the beginning of this article for additional technical requirements before having the connector attempt to create a table.

- `<schema>`: The name of the schema  (formerly known as a database) in Unity Catalog for the target volume. The default is `default` if not otherwise specified.

  If the target volume and table are in the same schema (formerly known as a database), then `<schema>` and `<database>` will have the same values.

- `<volume>` (_required_): The name of the target volume in Unity Catalog.
- `<volume_path>`: Any target folder path inside of the volume to use instead of the volume's root. If not otherwise specified, processing occurs at the volume's root.

<Note>
    Using dashes (`-`) in the names of catalogs, schemas (formerly known as databases), tables, and volumes might cause isolated issues with the connector. It is 
    recommended to use underscores (`_`) instead of dashes in the names of catalogs, schemas, tables, and volumes.
