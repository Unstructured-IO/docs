<Note>
    If you're new to Unstructured, read this note first.
    
    Before you can create a source connector, you must first sign in to your Unstructured account:
    
    - If you do not already have an Unstructured account, [sign up for free](https://unstructured.io/?modal=try-for-free). 
      After you sign up, you are automatically signed in to your new Unstructured **Let's Go** account, at [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io). 
      To sign up for a **Business** account instead, [contact Unstructured Sales](https://unstructured.io/?modal=contact-sales), or [learn more](/api-reference/overview#pricing).
    - If you already have an Unstructured **Let's Go**, **Pay-As-You-Go**, or **Business SaaS** account and are not already signed in, sign in to your account at 
      [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io). For other types of **Business** accounts, see your Unstructured account administrator for sign-in instructions, 
      or email Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).

    After you sign in, the [Unstructured user interface](/ui/overview) (UI) appears, which you use to get your Unstructured API key, as follows:

    1. After you sign in to your Unstructured **Let's Go**, **Pay-As-You-Go**, or **Business** account, click **API Keys** on the sidebar.<br/>

       For a **Business** account, before you click **API Keys**, make sure you have selected the organizational workspace you want to create an API key 
       for. Each API key works with one and only one organizational workspace. [Learn more](/ui/account/workspaces#create-an-api-key-for-a-workspace).

    2. Click **Generate API Key**.<br/>
    3. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish generating the key.<br/>
    4. Click the **Copy** icon next to your new key to add the key to your system's clipboard. If you lose this key, simply return and click the **Copy** icon again.<br/>

    After you create the source connector, add it along with a 
    [destination connector](/api-reference/workflow/destinations/overview) to a [workflow](/api-reference/workflow/overview#workflows). 
    Then run the worklow as a [job](/api-reference/workflow/overview#jobs). To learn how, try out the 
    the notebook [Dropbox-To-Pinecone Connector API Quickstart for Unstructured](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Unstructured-IO/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/Dropbox_To_Pinecone_Connector_Quickstart.ipynb), 
    or watch the two 4-minute video tutorials for the [Unstructured Python SDK](/api-reference/workflow/overview#unstructured-python-sdk).
    
    You can also create source connectors with the Unstructured user interface (UI). 
    [Learn how](/ui/sources/overview).

    If you need help, email Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).

    You are now ready to start creating a source connector! Keep reading to learn how.
