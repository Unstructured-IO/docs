<Note>
    If you're new to Unstructured, read this note first.
    
    Before you can create a source connector, you must first sign in to your Unstructured account:
    
    - If you do not already have an Unstructured account, go to [https://unstructured.io/contact](https://unstructured.io/contact) and fill out the online form to indicate your interest.
    - If you already have an Unstructured account, go to [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io) and sign in by using the email address, Google account, 
      or GitHub account that is associated with your Unstructured account. 
    
    After you sign in, the [Unstructured user interface](/ui/overview) (UI) appears, which you use to get your Unstructured API key. 
    To learn how, watch this 40-second [how-to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucugLkYB6M).

    After you create the source connector, add it along with a 
    [destination connector](/api-reference/workflow/destinations/overview) to a [workflow](/api-reference/workflow/overview#workflows). 
    Then run the worklow as a [job](/api-reference/workflow/overview#jobs). To learn how, try out the 
    [hands-on Workflow Endpoint quickstart](/api-reference/workflow/overview#quickstart), 
    go directly to the [quickstart notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Unstructured-IO/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/Unstructured_Platform_Workflow_Endpoint_Quickstart.ipynb), 
    or watch the two 4-minute video tutorials for the [Unstructured Python SDK](/api-reference/workflow/overview#unstructured-python-sdk).
    
    You can also create source connectors with the Unstructured user interface (UI). 
    [Learn how](/ui/sources/overview).

    If you need help, reach out to the [community](https://short.unstructured.io/pzw05l7) on Slack, or 
    [contact us](https://unstructured.io/contact) directly.

    You are now ready to start creating a source connector! Keep reading to learn how.
