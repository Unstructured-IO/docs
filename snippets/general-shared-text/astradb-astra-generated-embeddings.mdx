## Astra DB Generated Embeddings
See the [Astra DB documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/databases/embedding-generation.html) for more information.

When **Astra DB Generated Embeddings** is enabled:
- Your document text will be inserted into the `$vectorize` field.
- Astra DB will automatically populate the `$vector` field with embeddings.
- Your workflow **must not** include an embedder node.
- You **must** have an embedding provider configured for your collection.

When **Astra DB Generated Embeddings** is disabled (the default):
 - Unstructured will insert embeddings directly into the `$vector` field
 - Your workflow **must** include an embedder node.

### Troubleshooting
You may encounter the following errors when running a job:

**Error**:

`Unable to vectorize data, embedding service not configured for the collection : <collection> (EMBEDDING_SERVICE_NOT_CONFIGURED) [with 0 inserted ids])`

You've enabled **Astra DB Generated Embeddings**, but your collection does not have an embedding provider. Either disable **Astra DB Generated Embeddings** in your connector settings, or recreate your collection with an embedding provider.

**Error**:

`Cannot use Unstructured embeddings and Astra-generated embeddings simultaneously. Please disable Astra generated embeddings or remove the Unstructured embedder.`

**or**:

`No vectors provided. Please enable an Unstructured embedding provider or configure Astra to generate embeddings.`

You must choose either Unstructured or Astra DB embeddings. Configuring neither, or both, is unsupported.
