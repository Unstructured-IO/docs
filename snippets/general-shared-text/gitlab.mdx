The GitLab prerequisites:

- A [GitLab account](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up).
- The URL for the target [GitLab repository](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/).
- A [GitLab access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/tokens/) that allows access to the repository.
- Optionally, the name of a specific branch to access in the repository. The repository's default repository branch is used if not otherwise specified.
- Optionally, a list of file globs to limit which types of files are accepted, for example `*.html` or `*.txt`.
