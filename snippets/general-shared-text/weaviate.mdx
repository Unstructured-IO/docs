1. A Weaviate database instance. The following information assumes that you have a Weaviate Cloud (WCD) account with a Weaviate database cluster in that account. 
   [Create a WCD account](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/quickstart#create-a-wcd-account). [Create a database cluster](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/quickstart#create-a-weaviate-cluster). For other database options, [learn more](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation).

2. The URL and API key for the database cluster. [Get the URL and API key](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/quickstart#explore-the-details-panel).

3. A collection in the database cluster. Note the name of the collection, also known as the collection's _class name_. [Create a collection](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/tools/collections-tool).

   The schema of the collection that you use must match the data that Unstructured writes to it. Otherwise, you might get unexpected results or errors. 
   Unstructured cannot provide a schema that is guaranteed to work for everyone in all circumstances. This is because these schemas will vary based on 
   your source files' types; how you want Unstructured to partition, chunk, and generate embeddings; 
   any custom post-processing code that you run; and other factors.

   You can adapt the following collection schema example for your own needs:

   ```json
   {
       "class": "Elements",
       "properties": [
           {
               "name": "element_id",
               "dataType": ["text"]
           },
           {
               "name": "text",
               "dataType": ["text"]
           },
           {
               "name": "embeddings",
               "dataType": ["number[]"]
           },
           {
               "name": "metadata",
               "dataType": ["object"],
               "nestedProperties": [
                   {
                       "name": "parent_id",
                       "dataType": ["text"]
                   },
                   {
                       "name": "page_number",
                       "dataType": ["text"]
                   },
                   {
                       "name": "is_continuation",
                       "dataType": ["boolean"]
                   },
                   {
                       "name": "orig_elements",
                       "dataType": ["text"]
                   }
               ]
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
