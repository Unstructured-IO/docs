- For the [Unstructured Platform](/platform/overview): only [Weaviate Cloud](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs) clusters are supported.
- For [Unstructured Ingest](/ingestion/overview): Weaviate Cloud clusters, 
  [Weaviate installed locally](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/quickstart/local), 
  and [Embedded Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/embedded) are supported.
- For Weaviate installed locally, you will need the name of the target collection on the local instance.
- For Embedded Weaviate, you will need the instance's connection URL and the name of the target collection on the instance.
- For Weaviate Cloud, you will need:

  - A Weaviate database instance. The following information assumes that you have a Weaviate Cloud (WCD) account with a Weaviate database cluster in that account. 
    [Create a WCD account](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/quickstart#create-a-wcd-account). [Create a database cluster](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/quickstart#create-a-weaviate-cluster). For other database options, [learn more](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation).
  - The name of the target collection in the database. [Create a collection](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/tools/collections-tool).
  - The URL and API key for the database cluster. [Get the URL and API key](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/quickstart#explore-the-details-panel).

    The following video describes how to set up Weaviate Cloud for Unstructured.

Weaviate requires the collection to have a data schema before you add data. At minimum, this schema must contain the `record_id` property, as follows:

```json
{
    "class": "Elements",
    "properties": [
        {
            "name": "record_id",
            "dataType": ["text"]
        }
    ]
}
```

Weaviate generates any additional properties based on the incoming data.

If you have specific schema requirements, you can define the schema manually. 
Unstructured cannot provide a schema that is guaranteed to work for everyone in all circumstances. 
This is because these schemas will vary based on 
your source files' types; how you want Unstructured to partition, chunk, and generate embeddings; 
any custom post-processing code that you run; and other factors.

You can adapt the following collection schema example for your own specific schema requirements:

```json
{
    "class": "Elements",
    "properties": [
        {
            "name": "record_id",
            "dataType": ["text"]
        },
        {
            "name": "element_id",
            "dataType": ["text"]
        },
        {
            "name": "text",
            "dataType": ["text"]
        },
        {
            "name": "embeddings",
            "dataType": ["number[]"]
        },
        {
            "name": "metadata",
            "dataType": ["object"],
            "nestedProperties": [
                {
                    "name": "parent_id",
                    "dataType": ["text"]
                },
                {
                    "name": "page_number",
                    "dataType": ["text"]
                },
                {
                    "name": "is_continuation",
                    "dataType": ["boolean"]
                },
                {
                    "name": "orig_elements",
                    "dataType": ["text"]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
