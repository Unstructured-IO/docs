The Weaviate prerequisites:

1. A Weaviate database instance. The following information assumes that you have a Weaviate Cloud (WCD) account with a Weaviate database cluster in that account. 
   [Create a WCD account](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/quickstart#create-a-wcd-account). [Create a database cluster](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/quickstart#create-a-weaviate-cluster). For other database options, [learn more](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation).

2. The URL and API key for the database cluster. [Get the URL and API key](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/quickstart#explore-the-details-panel).

3. A collection in the database cluster. Note the name of the collection, also known as the collection's _class name_. [Create a collection](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/tools/collections-tool).

   The schema of the collection that you use must match the data that Unstructured writes to it. Otherwise, you might get unexpected results or errors. 
   Unstructured cannot provide a schema that is guaranteed to work for everyone in all circumstances. This is because these schemas will vary based on 
   your source files' types; how you want Unstructured to partition, chunk, and generate embeddings; 
   any custom post-processing code that you run; and other factors. See:

   - [Collection schema](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/config-refs/schema)
   - [Unstructured document elements and metadata](/api-reference/api-services/document-elements)
