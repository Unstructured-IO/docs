To use the Amazon S3 console to add an access policy that allows all authenticated AWS IAM users in the 
corresponding AWS account to read and write to an existing S3 bucket, do the following.

<Info>Your organization might have stricter bucket policy requirements. Check with your AWS account 
  administrator if you are unsure.</Info>

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).
2. Open the [Amazon S3 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home).
3. Browse to the existing bucket and open it.
4. Click the **Permissions** tab.
5. In the **Bucket policy** area, click **Edit**.
6. In the **Policy** text area, copy the following JSON-formatted policy. 
   To change the following policy to restrict it to a specific user in the AWS account, change `root` to that 
   specific username.

   In this policy, replace the following:

   - Replace `<my-account-id>` with your AWS account ID.
   - Replace `<my-bucket-name>` in two places with the name of your bucket.

   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "AllowAuthenticatedUsersInAccountReadWrite",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": {
                   "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<my-account-id>:root"
               },
               "Action": [
                   "s3:GetObject",
                   "s3:PutObject",
                   "s3:ListBucket",
                   "s3:DeleteObject"
               ],
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:s3:::<my-bucket-name>",
                   "arn:aws:s3:::<my-bucket-name>/*"
               ],
               "Condition": {
                   "StringEquals": {
                       "aws:PrincipalType": "IAMUser"
                   }
               }
           }
       ]
