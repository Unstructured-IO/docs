- A Teradata ClearScape Analytics account, which includes:

  - An environment in the account.
  - A Teradata Vantage database in the environment.
  - A user name and password for the database.

  [Learn how](https://developers.teradata.com/quickstarts/get-access-to-vantage/clearscape-analytics-experience/getting-started-with-csae/).

- The database's corresponding server host name or IP address, as follows:

  1. Sign in to your Teradata ClearScape Analytics account.<br/>
  2. On the sidebar, under **Environments**, click the name of the database's corresponding environment.<br/>
  3. Under **Connection detals for Vantage database**, use the **Host** value.<br/>

- The name of the user who has the appropriate access to the database, as follows:

  1. Sign in to your Teradata ClearScape Analytics account.<br/>
  2. On the sidebar, under **Environments**, click the name of the database's corresponding environment.<br/>
  3. Under **Connection detals for Vantage database**, use the **Username** value.<br/>

  - The Teradata SQL command to get a list of available users is as follows:

    ```sql
    SELECT UserName 
    FROM DBC.UsersV 
    ORDER BY UserName;
    ```

- The password for the user, which you set up when you created the user. If you forget the password, [learn how to reset it](https://docs.teradata.com/r/Enterprise_IntelliFlex_VMware/Security-Administration/Managing-Database-Passwords/Managing-Common-Password-Problems/Resetting-Forgotten-Passwords).
- The name of the target database in the environment. To get a list of available databases in the environment, you can run a query such as the following:

  ```sql
  SELECT DatabaseName 
  FROM DBC.DatabasesV 
  ORDER BY DatabaseName;
  ```

- The name of the target table in the database. To get a list of available tables in a database, you can run a query such as the following, replacing `<database-name>` with the name of the target database:

  ```sql
  SELECT TableName
  FROM DBC.TablesV
  WHERE DatabaseName = '<database-name>' AND TableKind = 'T'
  ORDER BY TableName;
  ```

  When Unstructured writes rows to a table, the table's columns must have a schema that is compatible with Unstructured. 
  Unstructured cannot provide a schema that is guaranteed to work for everyone in all circumstances. 
  This is because these schemas will vary based on 
  your source files' types; how you want Unstructured to partition, chunk, and generate embeddings; 
  any custom post-processing code that you run; and other factors.

  In any case, note the following about table schemas:

  - The following columns are always required by Unstructured: `record_id` and `element_id`.
  - The following columns are optional for Unstructured, but highly recommended: `text` and `type`.
  - If Unstructured is generating vector embeddings, the `embeddings` column is also required.
  - The rest of the columns are optional and typically will be output by Unstructured as part of the `metadata` field.

  Here is an example table schema that is compatible with Unstructured. It includes all of the required and recommended columns, as 
  well as a few additional columns that are typically output by Unstructured as part of the `metadata` field.

  ```sql
  CREATE SET TABLE "<database-name>".elements (
     "id" VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
     PRIMARY KEY ("id"),
     "record_id" VARCHAR(64),
     "element_id" VARCHAR(64),
     "text" VARCHAR(32000) CHARACTER SET UNICODE,
     "type" VARCHAR(50),
     "embeddings" VARCHAR(64000),
     "last_modified" VARCHAR(50),
     "languages" VARCHAR(200),
     "file_directory" VARCHAR(500),
     "filename" VARCHAR(255),
     "filetype" VARCHAR(50),
     "record_locator" VARCHAR(1000),
     "date_created" VARCHAR(50),
     "date_modified" VARCHAR(50),
     "date_processed" VARCHAR(50),
     "permissions_data" VARCHAR(1000),
     "filesize_bytes" INTEGER,
     "parent_id" VARCHAR(64)
  )
  ```

- For the source connector, the name of the primary key column in the table (for example, a column named `id`, typically defined as `"id" VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY ("id")`).
- For the source connector, the names of any specific columns to fetch from the table. By default, all columns are fetched unless otherwise specified.
- For the destination connector, the name of the column in the table that uniquely identifies each record for Unstructured to perform any necessary record updates. By default convention, Unstructured expects this field to be named `record_id`.
