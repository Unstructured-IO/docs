  2. In Snowsight, on the navigation menu, click your username, and then click **Account > View account details**.
  3. On the **Account** tab, note the value of the **Account Identifier** field.

  Alternatively, the following Snowflake query returns the current account's identifier:

  ```text
  SELECT CURRENT_ORGANIZATION_NAME() || '-' || CURRENT_ACCOUNT_NAME() AS "Account Identifier"
  ```

- The Snowflake [user's login name (not its username) and its password](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/admin-user-management#creating-users) in the account.

  To view the login name for a user:

  1. Log in to [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/ui-snowsight-homepage) with your Snowflake account.
  2. In Snowsight, on the navigation menu, click **Admin > Users & Roles**.
  3. On the **Users** tab, in the list of available users, click the name of the target user.

  Alternatively, the following Snowflake query returns information about the user with the username of `<my-user>`, including their `login_name` value representing their login name:

  ```text
  SHOW USERS LIKE '<my-user>';
  ```

- The name of the Snowflake [role](https://docs.snowflake.com/sql-reference/sql/create-role) that the user belongs to and that also has sufficient access to the Snowflake database, schema, table, and host.

  - To create a database in Snowflake, the role needs to be granted `CREATE DATABASE` privilege at the current account level; and `USAGE` privilege on the warehouse that is used to create the database.
  - To create a schema in a database in Snowflake, the role needs to be granted `USAGE` privilege on the database and the warehouse that is used to create the schema; and `CREATE SCHEMA` on the database.
  - To create a table in a schema in Snowflake, the role needs to be granted `USAGE` privilege on the database and schema and the warehouse that is used to create the table; and `CREATE TABLE` on the schema.
  - To write to a table in Snowflake, the role needs to be granted `USAGE` privilege on the database and schema and the warehouse that is used to write to the table; and `INSERT` on the table.
  - To read from a table in Snowflake, the role needs to be granted `USAGE` privilege on the database and schema and the warehouse that is used to write to the table; and `SELECT` on the table.

  To view a list of available roles in the current Snowflake account:

  1. Log in to [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/ui-snowsight-homepage) with your Snowflake account.
  2. In Snowsight, on the navigation menu, click **Admin > Users & Roles**.
  3. Click the **Roles** tab.

  Alternatively, the following Snowflake query returns a list of available roles in the current account:

  ```text
  SHOW ROLES;
  ```

  To view a list of available warehouses in the current Snowflake account:

  1. Log in to [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/ui-snowsight-homepage) with your Snowflake account.
  2. In Snowsight, on the navigation menu, click **Admin > Warehouses**. This view does not provide access to the warehouses' hostnames or port numbers. To get this information, you must run a Snowflake query.

  The following Snowflake query returns a list of available warehouse types, hostnames, and port numbers in the current account. Look for the row with a `type` of `SNOWFLAKE_DEPLOYMENT`:

  ```text
  SELECT t.VALUE:type::VARCHAR as type,
         t.VALUE:host::VARCHAR as host,
         t.VALUE:port as port
  FROM TABLE(FLATTEN(input => PARSE_JSON(SYSTEM$ALLOWLIST()))) AS t;
  ```

- The name of the Snowflake [database](https://docs.snowflake.com/sql-reference/sql/create-database) in the account.

  To view a list of available databases in the current Snowflake account:

  1. Log in to [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/ui-snowsight-homepage) with your Snowflake account.
  2. In Snowsight, on the navigation menu, click **Data > Databases**.

  Alternatively, the following Snowflake query returns a list of available databases in the current account:

  ```text
  SHOW DATABASES;
  ```

- The name of the [schema](https://docs.snowflake.com/sql-reference/sql/create-schema) in the database.

  To view a list of available schemas for a database in the current Snowflake account:

  1. Log in to [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/ui-snowsight-homepage) with your Snowflake account.
  2. In Snowsight, on the navigation menu, click **Data > Databases**.
  3. Expand the name of the target database.

  Alternatively, the following Snowflake query returns a list of available schemas in the current account:

  ```text
  SHOW SCHEMAS;
  ```

  The following Snowflake query returns a list of available schemas for the database named `<database_name>` in the current account:

  ```text
  SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE <database_name>;
  ```

- The name of the [table](https://docs.snowflake.com/sql-reference/sql/create-table) in the schema.

  To view a list of available tables for a schema in a database in the current Snowflake account:

  1. Log in to [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/ui-snowsight-homepage) with your Snowflake account.
  2. In Snowsight, on the navigation menu, click **Data > Databases**.
  3. Expand the name of the database that contains the target schema.
  4. Expand the name of the target schema. 
  5. Expand **Tables**.

  Alternatively, the following Snowflake query returns a list of available tables for the schema named `<schema_name>` in the datbase named 
  `<database_name>` in the current account:

  ```text
  SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA <database_name>.<schema_name>;
  ```

  Snowflake requires the target table to have a defined schema before Unstructured can write to the table. The recommended table 
  schema for Unstructured is as follows. In the following `CREATE TABLE` statement, replace the following placeholders with the appropriate values:

  - `<database_name>`: The name of the target database in the Snowflake account.
  - `<schema_name>`: The name of the target schema in the database.
  - `<number-of-dimensions>`: The number of dimensions for any embeddings that you plan to use. This value must match the number of dimensions for any embeddings that are  
    specified in your related Unstructured workflows or pipelines. If you plan to use Snowflake vector embedding generation or Snowflake vector search, 
    this value must match the number of dimensions that you plan to have Snowflake generate or search against.

  ```sql SQL

    ID VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL DEFAULT UUID_STRING(),
