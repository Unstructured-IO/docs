  2. In Snowsight, on the navigation menu, click your username, and then click **Account > View account details**.
  3. On the **Account** tab, note the value of the **Account Identifier** field.

  Alternatively, the following Snowflake query returns the current account's identifier:

  SELECT CURRENT_ORGANIZATION_NAME() || '-' || CURRENT_ACCOUNT_NAME() AS "Account Identifier"
  ```

- A Snowflake user, which can be a service user (recommended) or a human user.

  To create a programmatic access token (PAT) for a user:

  1. Log in to [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/ui-snowsight-homepage) with your Snowflake account.
  2. In Snowsight, on the navigation menu, click **Admin > Users & Roles**.
  3. On the **Users** tab, in the list of available users, click the name of the target user.
  4. In the **Programmatic access tokens** tile, click the **Generate new token** button.
  5. Follow the on-screen guidance to specify the PAT's settings.

     <Warning>
         You must set an expiration date for the PAT. This expiration date can be as soon as one day after the PAT is created or up to one year or even later. 
         Once this PAT expires, the connector will stop working. 
         To make sure that your connector continues to work, before your current PAT expires, you must follow this procedure again to generate a new PAT and 
         update your connector's settings with your new PAT's value.

         Unstructured does not notify you when a PAT is about to expire or has already expired. 
         You are responsible for tracking your PATs' expiration dates and taking corrective action before they expire.
     </Warning>

  6. Click **Generate**.
  7. Copy the generated PAT's value to a secure location, as you will not be able to access it again. If you lose this PAT's value, 
     you will need to repeat this procedure to generate a new, replacement one.

  The PAT will not work unless the Snowflake account also has a valid 
  [network rule](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/network-rules) along with a valid 
  [network policy](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/network-policies) attached to that rule. 
  The network rule must also be activated on the Snowflake account to begin taking effect.

  To create a valid network rule:

  1. Log in to [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/ui-snowsight-homepage) with your Snowflake account.
  2. In Snowsight, on the navigation menu, click **Admin > Security > Network Rules**.
  3. Click **+ Network Rule**.
  4. Enter some name for the network rule.
  5. For **Type**, select **IPv4**.
  6. For **Mode**, select **Ingress**.
  7. For **Identifiers**, next to the magnifying glass icon, enter `0.0.0.0/0`, and then press **Enter**.

     <Note>
         The `0.0.0.0/0` value allows all IP addresses to access the Snowflake account. 
         You can specify a more specific IP address range if you prefer. However, this more specific IP address range 
         will apply to all users, including the user for which you created the PAT.
     </Note>

  8. Click **Create Network Rule**.

  To create a valid network policy, attaching the preceding network rule to this policy at the same time:

  1. Log in to [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/ui-snowsight-homepage) with your Snowflake account.
  2. In Snowsight, on the navigation menu, click **Admin > Security > Network Policies**.
  3. Click **+ Network Policy**.
  4. Enter some name for the network policy.
  5. Make sure **Allowed** is selected.
  5. In the **Select rule** drop-down list, select the precedingnetwork rule to attach to this network policy.
  6. Click **Create Network Policy**.

  To activate the network rule in the account:

  1. Log in to [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/ui-snowsight-homepage) with your Snowflake account.
  2. In Snowsight, on the navigation menu, click **Admin > Security > Network Policies**.
  3. Click the name of the precedingnetwork policy to activate.
  4. In the policy's side panel, click the ellipsis (three dots) icon, and then click **Activate On Account**.
  5. Click **Activate policy**.

- (No longer recommended, as passwords are being deprecated by Snowflake&mdash;use PATs instead) The Snowflake [user's login name (not username) and the user's password](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/admin-user-management#creating-users) in the account. 
  This user must be a human user. Passwords are not supported for service users.
- The name of the Snowflake [role](https://docs.snowflake.com/sql-reference/sql/create-role) that the user belongs to and that also has sufficient access to the Snowflake database, schema, table, and host.

  - To create a database in Snowflake, the role needs to be granted `CREATE DATABASE` privilege at the current account level; and `USAGE` privilege on the warehouse that is used to create the database.
  - To create a schema in a database in Snowflake, the role needs to be granted `USAGE` privilege on the database and the warehouse that is used to create the schema; and `CREATE SCHEMA` on the database.
  - To create a table in a schema in Snowflake, the role needs to be granted `USAGE` privilege on the database and schema and the warehouse that is used to create the table; and `CREATE TABLE` on the schema.
  - To write to a table in Snowflake, the role needs to be granted `USAGE` privilege on the database and schema and the warehouse that is used to write to the table; and `INSERT` on the table.
  - To read from a table in Snowflake, the role needs to be granted `USAGE` privilege on the database and schema and the warehouse that is used to write to the table; and `SELECT` on the table.

  To view a list of available roles in the current Snowflake account:

  1. Log in to [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/ui-snowsight-homepage) with your Snowflake account.
  2. In Snowsight, on the navigation menu, click **Admin > Users & Roles**.
  3. Click the **Roles** tab.

  Alternatively, the following Snowflake query returns a list of available roles in the current account:

  2. In Snowsight, on the navigation menu, click **Admin > Warehouses**. This view does not provide access to the warehouses' hostnames or port numbers. To get this information, you must run a Snowflake query.

  The following Snowflake query returns a list of available warehouse types, hostnames, and port numbers in the current account. Look for the row with a `type` of `SNOWFLAKE_DEPLOYMENT`:

  ```text
  SELECT t.VALUE:type::VARCHAR as type,
         t.VALUE:host::VARCHAR as host,
         t.VALUE:port as port
  FROM TABLE(FLATTEN(input => PARSE_JSON(SYSTEM$ALLOWLIST()))) AS t;
  ```

  Snowflake requires the target table to have a defined schema before Unstructured can write to the table. The recommended table 
  schema for Unstructured is as follows. In the following `CREATE TABLE` statement, replace the following placeholders with the appropriate values:

  - `<database_name>`: The name of the target database in the Snowflake account.
  - `<schema_name>`: The name of the target schema in the database.
  - `<number-of-dimensions>`: The number of dimensions for any embeddings that you plan to use. This value must match the number of dimensions for any embeddings that are  
    specified in your related Unstructured workflows or pipelines. If you plan to use Snowflake vector embedding generation or Snowflake vector search, 
    this value must match the number of dimensions that you plan to have Snowflake generate or search against.
