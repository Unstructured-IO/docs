You can connect any available source connector to any available destination connector. However, the source connector code examples in the 
documentation show connecting only to the local destination connector. Similarly, the destination connector code examples in the 
documentation show connecting only to the local source connector. 

To quickly generate an Unstructured Ingest Python library code example that connects _any_ available source connector to _any_ available destination connector, 
do the following:

1. Open the [Unstructured Ingest Code Generator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/MariaK/unstructured-pipeline-builder) webpage.
2. Select your input (source) location type from the **Get unstructured documents from** drop-down list.
3. Select your output (destination) location type from the **Upload RAG-ready documents to** drop-down list.
4. Select your chunking strategy from the **Chunking strategy** drop-down list:

   - **None** - Do not chunk the data elements' content.
   - **basic** - Combine sequential data elements to maximally fill each chunk. However, do not mix `Table` and non-`Table` elements in the same chunk.
   - **by_title** - Use the `basic` strategy and also preserve section boundaries. Optionally preserve page boundaries as well.
   - **by_page** - Use the `basic` strategy and also preserve page boundaries.
   - **by_similarity** - Use the `sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1` embedding model to identify topically similar sequential elements and combine them into chunks. This strategy is availably only when calling Unstructured. 

   To learn more, see [Chunking strategies](/platform-api/partition-api/chunking) and [Chunking configuration](/ingestion/ingest-configuration/chunking-configuration).

5. For any chunking strategy other than **None**:

   - Enter your chunk size in the **Chunk size (characters)** box, or leave the default of **1000** characters. 
   - If you need to apply overlapping to the chunks, enter the chunk overlap size in the **Chunk overlap (characters)** box, or leave default of **20** characters.

   To learn more, see [Chunking configuration](/ingestion/ingest-configuration/chunking-configuration).

6. To generate vector embeddings, select the provider in the **Embedding provider** drop-down list.

   To learn more, see [Embedding configuraton](/ingestion/ingest-configuration/embedding-configuration).

7. Click **Generate code**. 
8. Copy the example code from the **Generated Code** pane into your code project. 
9. The code example will contain one or more environment variables that you must set for the code to run correctly. To learn what to 
set these variables to, click the documentation links that are below the **Generated Code** pane.
