Whether you're using the free Unstructured API, the Unstructured Serverless API, Unstructured API on Azure/AWS, or your local
deployment of Unstructured API, you can work with the API by sending single-file POST requests to it. 

import UseIngestOrPlatformInstead from '/snippets/general-shared-text/use-ingest-or-platform-instead.mdx';

<UseIngestOrPlatformInstead />

To make POST requests, you will need:

import SharedAPIKeyURL from '/snippets/general-shared-text/api-key-url.mdx';

<SharedAPIKeyURL />

Let's start with a simple example in which you send a PDF file (`*.pdf`) to partition via Unstructured API. 

```bash
 curl -X 'POST' \
  '$UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -H 'unstructured-api-key: $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY' \
  -F 'files=@sample-docs/report.pdf' \
  -F 'strategy=hi_res' \
  -o 'sample-docs/report.json'
```

In the example above we're representing the API endpoint with the environment variable `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL`. Note, however, that you also need to authenticate yourself with
your individual API Key, represented by the environment variable `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY`. Learn how to obtain an API URL and API key in the [Unstructured Platform Partition API guide](/platform-api/partition-api/overview).

## Parameters & examples

The API parameters are the same across all methods of accessing the Unstructured API.

* Refer to the [API parameters](/platform-api/partition-api/api-parameters) page for the full list of available parameters.
* Refer to the [Examples](/platform-api/partition-api/examples) page for some inspiration on using the parameters.

## Postman collection

Unstructured offers a [Postman collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collections/collections-overview/) that you can import into Postman to make POST requests through a graphical user interface.

1. [Install Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/).
