Whether you're using the free Unstructured API, the Unstructured Serverless API, Unstructured API on Azure/AWS, or your local
deployment of Unstructured API, you can work with the API by sending single-file POST requests to it. 

import UseIngestOrPlatformInstead from '/snippets/general-shared-text/use-ingest-or-platform-instead.mdx';

<UseIngestOrPlatformInstead />

To make POST requests, you will need:

import SharedAPIKeyURL from '/snippets/general-shared-text/api-key-url.mdx';

<SharedAPIKeyURL />

Let's start with a simple example in which you send a PDF file (`*.pdf`) to partition via Unstructured API. 

```bash
 curl -X 'POST' \
  '$UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -H 'unstructured-api-key: $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY' \
  -F 'files=@sample-docs/report.pdf' \
  -F 'strategy=hi_res' \
  -o 'sample-docs/report.json'
```

In the example above we're sending the request to the Free Unstructured API, in which case the API URL is the same for all
users: `https://api.unstructured.io/general/v0/general` and is represented by the environment variable `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL`. Note, however, that you still need to authenticate yourself with
your individual API Key, represented by the environment variable `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY`. Learn how to obtain an API key in the [Unstructured Platform Partition API guide](/platform-api/partition-api/overview).

If you are using the Unstructured Serverless API, you need to replace the URL in this example with the unique API URL that you have
received in the same email as your API key. For Unstructured API on Azure/AWS, use the API URL that you
configured through those services.

## Parameters & examples

The API parameters are the same across all methods of accessing the Unstructured API.

* Refer to the [API parameters](/platform-api/partition-api/api-parameters) page for the full list of available parameters.
* Refer to the [Examples](/platform-api/partition-api/examples) page for some inspiration on using the parameters.
