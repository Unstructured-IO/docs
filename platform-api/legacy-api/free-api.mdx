title: Free Unstructured API
description: This page describes how to obtain an API key to use with the free Unstructured API, the limitations of the free Unstructured API, and provides a quickstart example.

<Info>
    The Free Unstructured API is different than the free 14-day trial for the [Unstructured Platform API](/platform-api/overview) 
    or the free 14-day trial for the [Unstructured Platform API](/platform/api/overview).

## Get an API key

The Free Unstructured API requires authentication via an API key. Here's how you can obtain your API key:

1.  Go to [https://unstructured.io/api-key-free](https://unstructured.io/api-key-free).
2.  Fill out the registration form. Make sure your contact information (especially your **Email**) is valid.
3.  Check the **I agree** box if you consent to Unstructured contacting you about our products and services.
4.  Click the **Terms and Conditions** link, read it, and check the related box to agree.
5.  Click **Submit**. You will receive a Free Unstructured API key at the **Email** you provided. Store your API key in a secure location. Do not share it with others.
6.  For the Free Unstructured API, the API URL is `https://api.unstructured.io/general/v0/general`

## Free Unstructured API limitations

The Free Unstructured API is designed for prototyping purposes, and not for production use:
* The API usage is limited to 1000 pages per month.
* Unlike the users of Unstructured Serverless API, users of the Free Unstructured API do not get their own dedicated infrastructure.
* The data sent over the Free Unstructured API can be used for model training purposes, and other service improvements.

If you require a production-ready API, consider using the [Unstructured Platform API](/platform-api/overview) instead.

## Quickstart

These examples use your local machine. They send source (input) files from your local machine to the Unstructured Serverless API which delivers the processed data to a destination (output) location, also on your local machine. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

### Unstructured Ingest CLI

To work with the Free Unstructured API by using the [Unstructured Ingest CLI](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-cli), you will need to:

- Install Python, and then install the CLI package:

  ```bash
  pip install unstructured
  ```

- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your Free Unstructured API key.
- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` environment variable to your Free Unstructured API URL, which is `https://api.unstructured.io/general/v0/general`

- Have some compatible files on your local machine to be processed. [See the list of supported file types](/platform-api/supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

Now, use the CLI to call the API, replacing:

- `<path/to/input>` with the source (input) path to the directory on your local machine that contains the compatible files for Unstructured to process on its hosted compute resources.
- `<path/to/output>` with the destination (output) path to the directory on your local machine that will contain the processed data that Unstructured returns from its hosted compute resources.

```bash CLI
unstructured-ingest \
  local \
    --input-path <path/to/input> \
    --output-dir <path/to/output> \
    --partition-by-api \
    --api-key $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY \
    --partition-endpoint $UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL \
    --strategy hi_res \
    --additional-partition-args="{\"split_pdf_page\":\"true\", \"split_pdf_allow_failed\":\"true\", \"split_pdf_concurrency_level\": 15}"
```

After the command successfully runs, see the results in the specified output path on your local machine.

### Unstructured Ingest Python library

To work with the Unstructured Serverless API by using the [Unstructured Python library](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-python-library), you will need to:

- Install Python, and then install the CLI package:

  ```bash
  pip install unstructured-ingest
  ```

- Set the following environment variables:

  - Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` to your API key.
  - Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` to your API URL.
  
  [Get your API key and API URL](#get-started).

- Have some compatible files on your local machine to be processed. [See the list of supported file types](/platform-api/supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub. If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

Now, use the CLI to call the API, replacing:

- `<path/to/input>` with the source (input) path to the directory on your local machine that contains the compatible files for Unstructured to process on its hosted compute resources.
- `<path/to/output>` with the destination (output) path to the directory on your local machine that will contain the processed data that Unstructured returns from its hosted compute resources.

After the command successfully runs, see the results in the specified output path on your local machine.
