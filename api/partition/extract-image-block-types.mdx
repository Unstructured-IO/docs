title: Extract images and tables from documents
---

## Task

You want to get, decode, and show elements, such as images and tables, that are embedded in a PDF document.

## Approach

Extract the Base64-encoded representation of specific elements, such as images and tables, in the document. 
For each of these extracted elements, decode the Base64-encoded representation of the element into its original visual representation 
and then show it.

## To run this example

You will need a document that is one of the document types supported by the `extract_image_block_types` argument. 
See the `extract_image_block_types` entry in [API Parameters](/api/partition/api-parameters). 
This example uses a PDF file with embedded images and tables.

import SharedAPIKeyURL from '/snippets/general-shared-text/api-key-url.mdx';
import ExtractImageBlockTypesPy from '/snippets/how-to-api/extract_image_block_types.py.mdx';

## Code

For the [Unstructured Python SDK](/api/partition/sdk-python), you'll need:
<SharedAPIKeyURL />
<ExtractImageBlockTypesPy />
