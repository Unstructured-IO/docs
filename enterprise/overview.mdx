Unstructured offers _enterprise_ deployments, which allow you to use an Unstructured Enterprise account to run the [Unstructured user interface](/ui/overview) (UI) 
and the [Unstructured API](/api-reference/overview) as follows:

- <Icon icon="shield-halved" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a **private SaaS** deployment - Hosted within a virtual private cloud (VPC) on Unstructured's cloud infrastructure.
- <Icon icon="shield" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Within an **in-VPC** deployment - Hosted within your own VPC on your own cloud infrastructure.

Unstructured Enterprise accounts allow for multiple users and offer multiple workspaces. These enterprise deployments isolate your Unstructured Enterprise account 
from all other Unstructured accounts. Enterprise deployments also allow for robust customization of Unstructured's features for your unique needs.

- To sign up for Unstructured Enterprise, [contact Unstructured Sales](https://unstructured.io/contact).
- To switch from an Unstructured Starter or Team account to Enterprise, email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).

Unstructured Enterprise deployments provide benefits such as the following:

- _Security, privacy, and ownership_: Your organization might have strict data security requirements to keep your data and models within a virtual private cloud (VPC).
- _Compliance and data sovereignty_: Certain industries and locales might have regulatory requirements that require data to be processed and for data and models to be stored in specific cloud provider regions.
- _Customization_: Enterprise deployments allow for more customization and control options over your environments.
- _Testing and development_: Enterprise deployments can be useful for multi-environment testing and development purposes, allowing you to experiment with Unstructured in a testing environment without affecting your production environment.

## Getting started

To get started with an Enterprise deployment, your organization must first sign an Enterprise agreement with Unstructured. 
This agreement outlines the terms and conditions for your organization's use of Unstructured.

To begin the Enterprise agreement process, contact your Unstructured sales representative, or email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).

After your organization has signed the Enterprise agreement, a member of the Unstructured technical enablement team will reach out to you to begin the 
deployment onboarding process.

- For a private SaaS deployment, a member of the Unstructured technical enablement team will reach out to you with the unique URL to log in to 
  the Unstructured UI, along with any next steps that you need to take.
- For an in-VPC deployment, your organization will work with a member of the Unstructured technical enablement team to deploy Unstructured 
  into your own cloud instrastructure. You are encouraged to begin setting up your target environment as soon as possible. To do this, 
  see the onboarding requirements for your [AWS](/enterprise/aws/onboard), [Azure](/enterprise/azure/onboard), or  
  [GCP](/enterprise/gcp/onboard) account.

## Bare metal deployments

Unstructured also offers custom bare metal deployments of Unstructured. For more information, contact your Unstructured sales representative, or email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).
