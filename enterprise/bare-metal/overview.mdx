## Getting started

To get started with a bare metal deployment, your organization must first sign a bare metal agreement with Unstructured. 
This agreement outlines the terms and conditions for your organization to use Unstructured.

To begin the bare metal agreement process, contact your Unstructured sales representatives, or email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).

After your organization has signed the bare metal agreement, a member of the Unstructured technical enablement team will reach out to you to begin the 
deployment onboarding process. To streamline this process, you are encouraged to begin setting up your target environment as soon as possible. To do this, 
see the [onboarding checkist](/enterprise/bare-metal/onboard).
