## Getting started

To get started with an Enterprise deployment, your organization must first sign an Enterprise agreement with Unstructured. 
This agreement outlines the terms and conditions for your organization to use Unstructured.

To begin the Enterprise agreement process, contact your Unstructured sales representative, or email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).

After your organization has signed the Enterprise agreement, a member of the Unstructured technical enablement team will reach out to you to begin the 
deployment onboarding process. To streamline this process, you are encouraged to begin setting up your target environment as soon as possible. To do this, 
see the [onboarding checkist](/enterprise/azure/onboard).
