title: Security and compliance overview
sidebarTitle: Overview
---

This document outlines the security features and compliance posture of the software system. 
It is intended to provide customers and stakeholders with a clear understanding of the security 
mechanisms in place and the standards to which the system adheres.

## Encryption

**In Transit**

- All inter-service communication within the Kubernetes cluster is encrypted using mutual TLS (mTLS) via Istio service mesh.
- All ingress and egress communication uses TLS 1.2 or higher.

**At Rest**

- Data stored in blob storage is encrypted at rest using cloud-native encryption mechanisms (e.g., Azure Storage Service Encryption, AWS S3 Server-Side Encryption).
- Encryption keys are managed by the underlying cloud provider and rotated according to provider best practices.

## Secrets management

- Secrets are securely managed using the CSI (Container Storage Interface) driver with support for:

  - Azure Key Vault
  - AWS Secrets Manager
  - Google Secret Manager

- Secrets are mounted into pods at runtime and are never stored in plaintext in the cluster.
- Access to secrets is controlled through fine-grained identity and access management (IAM) policies, tied to the workload identity.
- Rotation of secrets is handled externally and reflected immediately via CSI mounts.

## Authentication and authorization

- End-user authentication is managed through Keycloak, which supports integration with external identity providers such as Azure Active Directory and Google Identity.
- Authentication follows the OAuth2 and OpenID Connect standards.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) is applied across the system.
- Roles and Permissions:

  - Super Admin
  - General Developer
  - Billing

## CI/CD and software supply chain security

- Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines include:

  - Static code analysis
  - Automated testing
  - Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) creation
  - Vulnerability scanning using Grype

- All container images are built from hardened, minimal base images and scanned prior to release.

## Logging and monitoring

- Logs are emitted to standard output and error streams (`stdout`/`stderr`) following container logging best practices.
- Logs can be collected by pluggable logging agents (e.g., Elastic Agent) deployed into the Kubernetes cluster.
- Centralized logging enables customers to integrate with their own observability solutions and meet internal audit requirements.
- Metrics are emitted to an Otel Collector which can be configured to ship to various observability solutions.

## Compliance

The system is designed and operated in accordance with industry-recognized security and data protection standards:

- **SOC 2 Type II**: Controls are implemented and audited for security, availability, and confidentiality.
- **ISO 27001**: Operational processes align with the ISO 27001 framework for information security management.
- **GDPR**: Data handling practices conform to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for protection of personal data.
- **FedRAMP**: The system meets the security requirements of the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) for U.S. government systems.

## Additional protections

- Each workflow job runs in an isolated, ephemeral Kubernetes namespace to ensure strong runtime separation.
- Namespaced service isolation within the Kubernetes cluster
