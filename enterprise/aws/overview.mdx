## Getting started

To get started with an Enterpise deployment, your organization must first sign an Enterprise agreement with Unstructured. 
This agreement outlines the terms and conditions for your organization to use Unstructured.

To begin the Enterprise agreement process, contact your Unstructured sales representative, or email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).

After your organization has signed the Enterprise agreement, a member of the Unstructured technical enablement team will reach out to you to begin the 
deployment onboarding process. While you wait, you can get started by following the onboarding checkist for your deployment type, if it applies to you:

- For dedicated instance deployments with AWS PrivateLink, follow the [onboarding checkist for AWS PrivateLink](/enterprise/aws/dedicated-instance-privatelink). 
- For in-VPC deployents, follow the [onboarding checkist for in-VPC on AWS](/enterprise/aws/onboard).
