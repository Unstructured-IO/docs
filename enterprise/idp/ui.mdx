<Note>
    The following information applies only to dedicated instance and in-VPC deployments of [Unstructured Enterprise](/enterprise/overview). 

    IdP integration is not available for Unstructured **Starter** or **Team** accounts.
</Note>

The following information assumes that Unstructured has already connected your organization's IdP to your Unstructured account. 
For more information, see [Getting started](/enterprise/idp/overview#getting-started).

## Add an IdP group to your Unstructured account

1. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your Unstructured account.
2. In the top navigation bar, in the organizational account selector, select the name of the organizational account that you want to add the IdP group to.

You can now assign roles to your newly added IdP group. These roles set the appropriate level of access by your 
IdP group to your Unstructured [account]() and to each of your account's [workspaces]().

## Assign an account role to an IdP group

This procedure assumes you have already added the IdP group to your Unstructured account. [Learn how](#add-an-idp-group-to-your-unstructured-account).

1. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your Unstructured account.
2. In the top navigation bar, in the organizational account selector, select the name of the organizational account that the IdP group belongs to.

The account role's permissions are enabled for each of the IdP group's existing users the next time they sign in to your 
Unstructured account. Whenever you add a user to the IdP group, they get the associated account role's permissions the next time they 
sign in. If a user is already signed in but is not getting the permissions they expect, the user should try signing out and then signing back in again. 
If you remove a user from the IdP group, the associated account role's permissions are revoked for them the next time they sign in.

The workspace role's permissions are enabled for each of the IdP group's existing users the next time they sign in to your

sign in. If a user is already signed in but is not getting the permissions they expect, the user should try signing out and then signing back in again.
