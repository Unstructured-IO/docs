<Note>
    The following information applies only to dedicated instance and in-VPC deployments of [Unstructured Enterprise](/enterprise/overview). 

    IdP integration is not available for Unstructured **Starter** or **Team** accounts.
</Note>

The following information assumes that Unstructured has already connected your organization's IdP to your Unstructured account. 
For more information, see [Getting started](/enterprise/idp/overview#getting-started).

## Add an IdP group to your Unstructured account

1. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your Unstructured account.
2. In the top navigation bar, in the organizational account selector, select the name of the organizational account that you want to add the IdP group to.
3. TODO: Describe how to go to the account's **Identity Provider Groups** page.
4. Click **New Group**.
5. On the **Connect Group** page, for **Identity Provider Group**, type the name of the IdP group that you want to add, and then click **Continue**.

   <Note>
       You must type the name of the IdP group exactly as it appears in your IdP. Otherwise, Unstructured will not be able to 
       successfully complete the connection to that IdP group through your IdP.
   </Note>

6. On the **Assign Role** page, for **Account Role**,select the name of the [organizational account role](/ui/account/roles#organizational-account-roles) that you want to assign to the IdP group for this 
   organizational account, and then click **Continue**.
7. On the **Assign Workspaces** page, for **Workspaces and permissions**, select each workspace&mdash;and the 
   [workspace role](/ui/account/roles#workspace-roles) for that workspace&mdash;that you want to assign to the IdP group, and then click **Add**.

   <Tip>
       You can also create a new workspace here&mdash;and assign the IdP group to it with a workspace role at the same time&mdash;by clicking **Add Workspace**.
   </Tip>

8. Click **Save Group**.

The account and workspace roles' permissions are enabled for each of the IdP group's existing users the next time they sign in to your 
Unstructured account. 

Whenever you add a user to the IdP group, they get the associated account and workspace roles' permissions the next time they 
sign in to your Unstructured account. 

If a user is already signed in to your Unstructured account but is not getting the permissions they expect, the user should try signing out of your Unstructured account and then signing back in again, to get those permissions. 

If you remove a user from the IdP group, the associated account and workspace roles' permissions are revoked for them the next time they sign in to your Unstructured account.

## Add individual users to your Unstructured account

Unstructured recommends that you add IdP groups to your Unstructured account, instead of adding individual users. 
Managing IdP groups can be easier, faster, and less error-prone than managing individual users. 
However, if you must add individual users to your Unstructured account, you can do so by following these steps.

1. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your Unstructured account.
2. In the top navigation bar, in the organizational account selector, select the name of the organizational account.
3. On the **Members** tab, click **New Member**.
4. On the **Add Member** page, for **Email**, type the email address of each individual user to add, and then click **Continue**.
5. On the **Assign Role** page, for **Account Role**, select the [organizational account role](/ui/account/roles#organizational-account-roles) for the individual users, and then click **Continue**.

   <Warning>
       An organizational account role that is assigned to an individual user always overrides any organizational account role that is assigned to any IdP group to which that user belongs. 
       This override happens the next time they sign in to your Unstructured account.
   </Warning>

6. On the **Assign Workspaces** page, for **Workspaces and permissions**, select each workspace&mdash;and the 
   [workspace role](/ui/account/roles#workspace-roles) for that workspace&mdash;that you want to assign to the individual users 
   for each workspace&mdash;and then click **Add**.

   <Warning>
       A workspace role that is assigned to an individual user always overrides any workspace role that is assigned to any IdP group to which that user belongs. 
       This override happens the next time they sign in to your Unstructured account.
   </Warning>

   <Tip>
       You can also create a new workspace here&mdash;and assign individual users to it with a workspace role at the same time&mdash;by clicking **Add Workspace**.
   </Tip>

7. Click **Invite Members**.
