title: Query processed PDF with HuggingChat
---

This example uses the [Unstructured Ingest Python library](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-python-library) or the 
[Unstructured JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](/api-reference/api-services/sdk-jsts) to send a PDF file to 
[Unstructured API services](/api-reference/api-services/overview) for processing. Unstructured processes the PDF and extracts the PDF's content. 
This example then sends some of the content to [HuggingChat](https://huggingface.co/chat/), Hugging Face's open-source AI chatbot, 
along with some queries about this content.

To run this example, you'll need:

- The [hugchat](https://pypi.org/project/hugchat/) package for Python, or the [huggingface-chat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/huggingface-chat) package for JavaScript/TypeScript.
- Your Unstructured API key and API URL. [Get an API key and API URL](/api-reference/api-services/saas-api-development-guide#get-started). 
- Your Hugging Face account's email address and account password. [Get an account](https://huggingface.co/join).
- A PDF file for Unstructured to process. This example uses a sample PDF file containing the text of the United States Constitution, 
available for download from [https://constitutioncenter.org/media/files/constitution.pdf](https://constitutioncenter.org/media/files/constitution.pdf).

import SharedAPIKeyURL from '/snippets/general-shared-text/api-key-url.mdx';

<SharedAPIKeyURL />

These environment variables:

- `HUGGING_FACE_EMAIL`, representing your Hugging Face account's email address. 
- `HUGGING_FACE_PASSWORD`, representing your Hugging Face account's email address.
- `HUGGING_FACE_COOKIE_DIR_PATH`, representing a login cookie cache path, typically `./cookies/` or `./login_cache/`.

This example's code is as follows:

import HuggingChatPyExampleCode from '/snippets/examples/huggingchat.py.mdx';
import HuggingChatTSExampleCode from '/snippets/examples/huggingchat.ts.mdx';

            Unstructured recommends that you use the [Unstructured Ingest Python library](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-python-library) instead. 
    
            The Ingest Python library provides faster processing of larger individual files, and faster and easier processing of multiple files at a time in batches.
