The legacy of the [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://thekingcenter.org/about-tkc/martin-luther-king-jr/) 
is one of courage, justice, and transformation. Historical records surrounding the assassination of Dr. King on 
April 4, 1968 were declassified on July 21, 2025 by the 
[U.S. National Archives and Records Administration](https://www.archives.gov/research/mlk). These documents provide 
important insights into a pivotal moment in American history and the civil rights movement.

Unstructured has published several resources that allow you to use techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to 
explore these documents and use them in your own applications. These resources include:

- The [MLK Archive Research Assistant](https://mlk-archive-chatbot-ababd73ca72b.herokuapp.com/) website, hosted by Unstructured, 
  which allows you to ask natural-language questions about these documents and get back answers in natural language, all in chatbot-style format. 
  To support these answers, source citations are also provided, including confidence scores and page references.
- A [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-mlk-archive-public/blob/main/MLK_Archive_RAG_Application.ipynb), 
  developed by Unstructured and hosted in [Google Colab](https://colab.google/), which demonstrates how to use a 
  [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html#notebook-documents) to access the same 
  resources as the preceding MLK Archive Research Assistant website. 
- A [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-mlk-archive-public) that contains additional details and 
  source code for the preceding resources.

  that contains links to all of the released 6,301 PDF source files spanning 243,496 pages of content, and 1 MP3 audio source file, for your own use. Additionally, 
  Unstructured has processed these PDF source files and made the processed output available as a single, downloadable 12.9 GB
