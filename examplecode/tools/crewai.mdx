[CrewAI](https://github.com/crewai/crewai) is a framework for building AI agents and multi-agent workflows.

This article provides a hands-on, step-by-step walkthrough that uses CrewAI, 
along with the [Unstructured Workflow Endpoint MCP Server](/examplecode/tools/mcp), to 
build a multi-agent workflow. This multi-agent workflow uses the MCP server to call various functions within the 
[Unstructured Workflow Endpoint](/api-reference/workflow/overview) to build Unstructured ETL+ workflows from the ground up. 
You can run this multi-agent workflow again and again with different inputs, without needing to touch the agents' original code 
or even knowing how to program, to have AI agents quickly build on your behalf multiple Unstructured ETL+ workflows with varying configurations.

## Requirements

To complete this walkthrough, you must first have an Unstructured account, an Unstructured API key for that account, 
an OpenAI API key, and the necessary Python and CrewAI open-source toolchain and project setups, as follows.

### Unstructured account and API key

Before you begin, you must have an Unstructured account and an Unstructured API key, as follows:

import GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly from '/snippets/general-shared-text/get-started-simple-api-only.mdx';

<GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly/>

### OpenAI API key

This example uses OpenAI with gpt-4o-mini. So, before you begin, you must also have an OpenAI API key. 
[Create or log in to your OpenAI account](https://auth.openai.com/create-account), and then 
[get an OpenAI API key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key) for your OpenAI account.

### Python and CrewAI open-source toolchain and project setup

Before you can start coding on your local machine, you must install the Python package and project manager [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), 
and install the CrewAI open source package, as follows.

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Install `uv`, as follows.

        By using `pip`:

        ```bash
        pip install uv
        ```

        Or, by using the following script (be sure to restart your terminal or Command Prompt after running the script):

        ```bash
        # For macOS and Linux:
        curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

        # For Windows:
        powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
        ```

        (To learn more about `uv`, see the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).)
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Install the CrewAI open-source package, as follows:

        ```bash
        uv tool install crewai
        ```

    </Step>
    <Step>
        Switch to the directory on you development machine where you want to create the project directory for this example, and then initialize the project. 
        This example creates a project directory named `crewai_unstructured_demo` within your current working directory and then 
        initializes the project.

        <Note>
            CrewAI open source works only with Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.
        </Note>

        ```bash
        crewai create crew crewai-unstructured-demo
        ```

        When prompted, select the LLM provider that you want to use. This example uses OpenAI with gpt-4o, so type the number for `openai` and then press `Enter`. 
        Then type the number next to `gpt-4o-mini` and press `Enter`.

        Then, when prompted, enter your OpenAI API key and press `Enter`.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Switch to the newly created project directory:

         ```bash
         cd crewai_unstructured_demo
         ```

        The core files that you will be working with in this example are in the `src/crewai_unstructured_demo` subdirectory. These core files include:

        - `config/agents.yaml`, which defines the AI agents that you will be using in this example.
        - `config/tasks.yaml`, which defines the tasks that the AI agents will be performing in this example.
        - `crew.py`, which defines the multi-agent workflow that you will be running in this example.
        - `main.py`, which runs the multi-agent workflow.
        - `.env`, which contains environment variables for this example, such as the LLM to use and your OpenAI API key.

    </Step>
    <Step>
        In the project's `.env` file, add the following environment variable, replacing `<key-here>` with your Unstructured API key:

        ```bash
        UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY=<key-here>
        ```

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ```bash
        crewai install
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

### ...

<Steps>
    <Step>
        In the root of the project directory, use Git to clone the Unstructured Workflow Endpoint MCP Server repository:

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/UNS-MCP.git
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ```bash
        cd UNS-MCP
        uv sync
        uv add mcp
        uv add -U unstructured-client
        uv add -U "crewai-tools[mcp]"
        ```
    </Step>
    
    <Step>
        ```bash
        uv run uns_mcp/server.py --port=8080
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

You are now ready to start coding.
