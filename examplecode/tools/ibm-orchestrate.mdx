[IBM watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate) helps you build, deploy and manage powerful 
AI assistants and agents that automate workflows and processes with generative AI.

This article provides a hands-on, step-by-step walkthrough that uses IBM watsonx Orchestrate to 
build a simple AI chat app. This chat app relies on data that is stored in an Astra DB or Milvus vector database. This data 
is generated by Unstructured and is based on your organization's source documents and semi-structured data.

## Requirements

To use this example, you will need the following:

If you want to connect Unstructured to Astra DB for providing the source data to IBM watsonx Orchestrate, you will need the following:

- An [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) or [DataStax account](https://astra.datastax.com/signup) account.
- An [Astra DB database](https://accounts.datastax.com/session-service/v1/login).
- To complete this example, you will need the following settings for the Astra DB database:

  - The database's API endpoint.
  - An application token for the database.
  - The name of the target keyspace in the database.
  - The name of the target collection in the keyspace.

  To get these settings, see the [Astra DB destination connector](/ui/destinations/astradb) documentation.

- Within your Unstructured account, a workflow that contains an Astra DB destination connector.

  - Create an [Unstructured account](https://unstructured.io/?modal=try-for-free).
  - Create an [Astra DB destination connector](/ui/destinations/astradb) in your Unstructured account.
  - Create a [custom workflow](/ui/workflows#create-a-custom-workflow) that contains the Astra DB destination connector in your Unstructured account.

    The workflow must generate [embeddings](/ui/embedding). The workflow's **Embedder** node's selected embedding model provider must be **IBM**. The 
    node's selected embedding model must match the embedding model that you will specify later in **Step 2**.

    Be sure to [run the workflow](/ui/workflows#edit%2C-delete%2C-or-run-a-workflow) to have Unstructured generate the data and store it in your Astra DB database.

After you meet the preceding requirements, skip ahead to [Step 1](#step-1%3A-add-an-ibm-watsonx-orchestrate-subscription-to-your-ibm-cloud-account).

If, however, you want to connect Unstructured to Milvus on IBM watsonx.data for providing the source data to IBM watsonx Orchestrate, you will need the following:

- Within your IBM Cloud account, an IBM watsonx.data subscription that contains a Milvus service instance.

  - Create an [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration).

    To complete this example, you must [create an API key](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/masv-and-l/cd?topic=cli-creating-your-cloud-api-key) for your IBM Cloud account.

  - Create an [IBM watsonx.data subscription](https://cloud.ibm.com/watsonxdata) in your IBM Cloud account.
  - Create a [Milvus service instance](/ui/destinations/milvus) within your IBM watsonx.data subscription plan. This instance 
    must contain a database, a collection, and an index to store and manage the data that is generated by Unstructured. 

    To complete this example, you will need the following settings for the Milvus service instance:
    
    - The instance's GRPC host value.
    - The instance's GRPC port value.
    - The name of the target database on the instance.
    - The name of the target collection in the database.
    - The name of the target index in the collection.

    To get these settings, see the [Milvus destination connector](/ui/destinations/milvus) documentation.

- Within your Unstructured account, a workflow that contains a Milvus destination connector.

  - Create an [Unstructured account](https://unstructured.io/signup).
  - Create a [Milvus destination connector](/ui/destinations/milvus) in your Unstructured account.
  - Create a [custom workflow](/ui/workflows#create-a-custom-workflow) that contains the Milvus destination connector in your Unstructured account.

    The workflow must generate [embeddings](/ui/embedding). The workflow's **Embedder** node's selected embedding model provider must be **IBM**. The 
    node's selected embedding model must match the embedding model that you will specify later in **Step 2**.

    Be sure to [run the workflow](/ui/workflows#edit%2C-delete%2C-or-run-a-workflow) to have Unstructured generate the data and store it in your Milvus instance's database.

## Step 1: Add an IBM watsonx Orchestrate subscription to your IBM Cloud account

If you already have an IBM watsonx Orchestrate subscription, then skip ahead to [Step 2](#step-2%3A-create-the-chat-app-in-ibm-watsonx-orchestrate)

1. [Log in to your IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/login).
2. On the sidebar, click the **Resource list** icon. If the sidebar is not visible, click the **Navigation Menu** icon to the far left of the 
   top navigation bar.
3. Click **Create resource**.
4. With **IBM Cloud catalog** selected, search for and select **watsonx Orchestrate**.
5. Complete the on-screen instructions to finish creating the IBM watsonx Orchestrate subscription.

## Step 2: Create the chat app in IBM watsonx Orchestrate

In this step, you use IBM watsonx Orchestrate to create a chat app. This chat app allows you to ask questions about 
your organization's documents and semi-structured data. This data is stored in your Astra DB or Milvus vector database and was 
generated by Unstructured in a format that is well-suited for your chat app.

   j. Click **Next**.<br/>

4. On the **Description** page, enter some description for the agent, and then click **Save**.
5. In the list of pages, click **Behavior**.
6. At the bottom of the **Behavior** section, turn on **Chat with documents**.
7. In the upper-right corner of the page, click **Deploy**. 
8. On the **Pre-deployment summary** page, click **Deploy**.

Skip ahead to [Step 3](#step-3%3A-run-the-chat-app).

If, however, you are using Milvus on IBM watsonx.data for providing the source data to IBM watsonx Orchestrate, then do the following:

1. On the **Select source** page, click **Milvus**, and then click **Next**.
2. On the **Connect Milvus** page, specify the following settings:

5. At the bottom of the **Behavior** section, turn on **Chat with documents**.
6. In the upper-right corner of the page, click **Deploy**. 
7. On the **Pre-deployment summary** page, click **Deploy**.

## Step 3: Run the chat app

In this step, you ask questions about your organization's source documents and semi-structured data. The chat app then 
attempts to answer your questions by searching the related data that Unstructured generated and stored in your Astra DB or Milvus vector database.

1. If the **Chat** page is not already open in IBM watsonx Orchestrate, click the **Open the main menu** icon to the far left of the 
   top navigation bar, and then click **Chat**.
2. In the sidebar, in the **Agents** list, select the name of the agent that you created in the previous step.
3. In the **Type something** box, enter a question, and then press `Enter`. 
4. The agent will provide an answer.
5. Keep asking as many questions as you want to.
