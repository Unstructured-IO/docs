### View orig_elements field contents as original JSON in Visual Studio Code

The contents of `orig_elements` fields in Unstructured JSON output are in gzipped Base64-encoded format. To view the contents of an `orig_elements` field in a human-readable format, 
do the following in Visual Studio Code:

1. Install the [Gzip / Unzip text](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xballoy.gzip-unzip-text) 
   extension into your installation of Visual Studio Code, as follows:

   a. On the menu bar, click **View > Extensions**.<br/>

   c. In the list of search results, for the **Gzip / Unzip text** extension, click **Install**.<br/>
   d. If prompted, click **Trust Publisher & Install**.<br/>

2. Download the Unstructured JSON output file locally, and then open the downloaded file in Visual Studio Code.

   <Note>
       We do not recommend that you format the JSON file for easier reading after you open it in Visual Studio Code. 
       This is because the formatting operation could introduce 
       unnecessary whitespace and line breaks into the contents of the `orig_elements` 
       fields. These additional characters could cause the extension to produce unexpected results or fail.
   </Note>

3. Select the contents of the `orig_elements` field that you want to decode and view. Do not select the 
   field name `"orig_elements"` or the opening or closing quotation marks around the field's contents.
4. Right-click the selected contents, and then click **Command Palette**. 
5. In the **Command Palette**, type `>Unzip Base64 encoded text`, and then press **Enter**. The human-readable JSON 
   appears in a separate editor tab.

2. Do one of the following:

   - Copy the contents of the `text_as_html` field to your system clipboard, and then paste it into the **Put your HTML text here** box. 
     This content must not contain the field name `"text_as_html"` or the opening or closing quotation marks around the field's contents.
   - Click **Import**, and then select a file containing only the contents of the `text_as_html` field. This file 
     must not contain the field name `"text_as_html"` or the opening or closing quotation marks around the field's contents.

<Tip>
    To add a one-pixel, black border to each cell in the rendered HTML for easier reading, 
    add the following CSS directive before the opening `<table>` tag:

    ```text
    <style>table { border-collapse: collapse; } th, td { border: 1px solid black; }</style> 
    ```

    To add a bit of visual padding to each cell, add the following CSS directive before the 
    opening `<table>` tag instead:

    ```text
    <style>th, td { border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px; }</style> 
    ```
</Tip>

After you paste or import the `text_as_html` field contents, the HTML is rendered on-screen.
