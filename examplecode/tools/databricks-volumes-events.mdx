title: Databricks Volumes event triggers
---

You can use Databricks Volumes events, such as uploading files to Databricks Volumes, to automatically run Unstructured ETL+ workflows 
that rely on those Databricks Volumes as sources. This enables a no-touch approach to having Unstructured automatically process files as they are uploaded to Databricks Volumes.

This example shows how to automate this process by adding a custom job in Lakeflow Jobs for your Databricks workspace in 
[AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/jobs/), [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/jobs/), or 
[GCP](https://docs.databricks.com/gcp/jobs). This job runs 
whenever a file upload event is detected in the specified Databricks Volume. This job uses a custom Databricks notebook to call the [Unstructured API's workflow operations](/api-reference/workflow/overview) to automatically run the 
specified corresponding Unstructured ETL+ workflow within your Unstructured account.

<Note>
    This example uses a custom job in Lakeflow Jobs and a custom Databricks notebookthat you create and maintain. 
    Any issues with file detection, timing, or job execution could be related to your custom job or notebook, 
    rather than with Unstructured. If you are getting unexpected or no results, be sure to check your custom 
    job's run logs first for any informational and error messages.

## Requirements

import GetStartedSimpleApiOnly from '/snippets/general-shared-text/get-started-simple-api-only.mdx'

To use this example, you will need the following:

- An Unstructured account, and an Unstructured API key for your account, as follows:

  <GetStartedSimpleApiOnly />

- The Unstructured API's workflow operations URL for your account, as follows:

  1. In the Unstructured UI, click **API Keys** on the sidebar.<br/>
  2. Note the value of the **Unstructured API's workflow operations** field.

- A Databricks Volumes source connector in your Unstructured account. [Learn how](/ui/sources/databricks-volumes). 
- Some available [destination connector](/ui/destinations/overview) in your Unstructured account.
- A workflow that uses the preceding source and destination connectors. [Learn how](/ui/workflows).

## Step 1: Create a notebook to run the Unstructured workflow

1. Sign in to the Databricks workspace within your Databricks account for AWS, Azure, or GCP that 
   corresponds to the workspace you specified for your Databricks Volumes source connector.
2. On the sidebar, click **+ New > Notebook**.
3. Click the notebook's title and change it to something more descriptive, such as `Unstructured Workflow Runner Notebook`.
4. In the notebook's first cell, add the following code:

   ```python
   !pip install requests
   ```

5. Click **Edit > Insert cell below**.
6. In this second cell, add the following code:

   ```python
   import requests, os

   url = '<unstructured-api-url>' + '/workflows/<workflow-id>/run'

   # Option 1 (Recommended): Get your Unstructured API key from Databricks Secrets.
   api_key = dbutils.secrets.get(scope="<scope>", key="<key>")

   # Option 2: Get your Unstructured API key from an environment variable stored on 
   # the notebook's attached compute resource.
   api_key = os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY")

   headers = {
       'accept': 'application/json',
       'content-type': 'application/json',
       'unstructured-api-key': api_key
   }

   json_data = {}

   try:
       response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=json_data)
       response.raise_for_status()
       print(f'Status Code: {response.status_code}')
       print('Response:', response.json())
   except Exception as e:
       print('An error occurred:', e)
   ```

7. Replace the placeholders in this second cell as follows:

   - Replace `<unstructured-api-url>` with the value of the **Unstructured API's workflow operations** field earlier from the requirements.
   - Replace `<workflow-id>` with the ID of the workflow that you want to run.
   - For your Unstructured API key, do one of the following:

     - (Recommended) If you want to use Databricks Secrets, replace `<scope>` and `<key>` with the scope and key names for the existing secret that you have already created in Databricks Secrets.

       [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/security/secrets/#secrets-overview), 
       [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/security/secrets/#secrets-overview), or 
       [GCP](https://docs.databricks.com/gcp/security/secrets#secrets-overview).
     - If you want to use environment variables on the attached compute resource, set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` to your Unstructured API key value. Learn how for 
       [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/compute/configure#environment-variables), 
       [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/compute/configure#environment-variables), or 
       [GCP](https://docs.databricks.com/gcp/compute/configure#environment-variables).


## Step 2: Create a job in Lakeflow Jobs to run the notebook

1. With your Databricks workspace still open from the previous step, on the sidebar, click **Jobs & Pipelines**.
2. Expand **Create new**, and then click **Job**.
3. Click the job's title and change it to something more descriptive, such as `Unstructured Workflow Runner Job`.
4. On the **Tasks** tab, enter some **Task name** such as `Run_Unstructured_Workflow_Runner_Notebook`.
5. With **Notebook** selected for **Type**, and with **Workspace** selected for **Source**, use the **Path** dropdown to select the notebook you created in the previous step.
6. For **Cluster**, select the cluster you want to use to run the notebook.
7. Click **Create task**.
8. In the **Job details** pane, under **Schedules & Triggers**, click **Add trigger**.
9. For **Trigger type**, select **File arrival**.
10. For **Storage location**, enter the path to the volume to monitor or, if you are monitoring a folder within that volume, the path to the folder. To get this path, do the following:

    a. On the sidebar, click **Catalog**.<br/>
    b. In the list of catalogs, expand the catalog that contains the volume you want to monitor.<br/>
    c. In the list of schemas (formerly known as databases), expand the schema that contains the volume you want to monitor.<br/>
    d. Expand **Volumes**.<br/>
    e. Click the volume you want to monitor.<br/>
    f. On the **Overview** tab, copy the path to the volume you want to monitor or, if you are monitoring a folder within that volume, click the path to the folder and then copy the path to that folder.<br/>

11. Click **Save**.

## Step 3: Trigger the job

1. With your Databricks workspace still open from the previous step, on the sidebar, click **Catalog**.
2. In the list of catalogs, expand the catalog that contains the volume that is being monitored.
3. In the list of schemas (formerly known as databases), expand the schema that contains the volume that is being monitored.
4. Expand **Volumes**.
5. Click the volume that is being monitored or, if you are monitoring a folder within that volume, click the folder.
6. Click **Upload to this volume**, and follow the on-screen instructions to upload a file to the volume or folder that is being monitored.

## Step 4: View trigger results

1. With your Databricks workspace still open from the previous step, on the sidebar, click **Jobs & Pipelines**.
2. On the **Jobs & pipelines** tab, click the name of the job you created earlier in Step 2.
3. On the **Runs** tab, wait until the current job run shows a **Status** of **Succeeded**.
4. In the Unstructured user interface for your account, click **Jobs** on the sidebar.
5. In the list of jobs, click the newly running job for your workflow.
6. After the job status shows **Finished**, go to your destination location to see the results.

## Step 5 (Optional): Pause the trigger

To stop triggering the job, with your job in Lakeflow Jobs still open earlier from Step 4, in the **Job details** pane, under **Schedules & Triggers**, click **Pause**.
