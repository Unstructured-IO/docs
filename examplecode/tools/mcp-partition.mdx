title: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Hands-On Walkthrough for the Unstructured Partition Endpoint
sidebarTitle: MCP for Partition Endpoint
---

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes 
how applications provide context to LLMs. From the MCP documentation:

> Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

This article provides a hands-on, step-by-step walkthrough to build a simple example on your local development machine
that integrates the [Unstructured API](/api-reference/overview) with MCP. Specifically, 
this walkthrough demonstrates how to run an MCP _server_ 
(a lightweight program that exposes specific capabilities through MCP); this MCP server uses the 
[Unstructured Partition Endpoint](/api-reference/workflow/overview) to partition a single file, with limited support 
for chunking as well, processing local files one file at a time.

<Note>
    For a hands-on walkthrough of the [Unstructured Workflow Endpoint](/api-reference/workflow/overview) instead, 
    see the [MCP Hands-On Walkthrough for the Unstructured Workflow Endpoint](/examplecode/tools/mcp), which offers 
    a full range of partitioning, chunking, embedding, and enrichment options for your files and data.
</Note>
 
You call this MCP server from an MCP _client_ (an application that maintains a one-to-one connection with an 
MCP server), which in this walkthrough is [Claude for Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), a chat-based interface, by asking it plain language questions. 
Other MCP clients are also available. [Learn more](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients).

## Requirements

To complete this walkthrough, you must first have an Unstructured account, an Unstructured API key for that account, 
the necessary Python toolchain and project setups, Claude for Desktop, and an input file for Unstructured to process, as follows.

### Unstructured account and API key

Before you begin, you must have an Unstructured account and an Unstructured API key, as follows:

import GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly from '/snippets/general-shared-text/get-started-simple-api-only.mdx';

<GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly/>

### Python toolchain and Claude for Desktop setup

Before you can start coding on your local machine, you must install the Python package and project manager `uv`, and install Claude for Desktop, as follows.

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Install `uv`, as follows.

        By using `pip`:

        ```bash
        pip install uv
        ```

        Or, by using the following script (be sure to restart your terminal or Command Prompt after running the script):

        ```bash
        # For macOS and Linux:
        curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

        # For Windows:
        powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
        ```

        (To learn more about `uv`, see the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).)
    </Step>
    <Step>
        [Install Claude for Desktop](https://claude.ai/download).
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Input file

You must have an input file for Unstructured to process. This file can be any file type that Unstructured supports, such as a `.pdf` file. 
[See the list of supported file types](/ui/supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

To minimize the risk of Claude for Desktop's hard timeout limit of 60 seconds for MCP server responses, we recommend that you use small files 
(less than 400 KB) for this walkthrough.

You are now ready to start coding.

## Step 1: Create the MCP server

<Steps>
    <Step>
        From your current working directory, create a project directory and then initialize it. This example creates a 
        project directory named `mcp-unstructured-parition-demo`. Then go to the project directory:

        ```bash
        uv init mcp-unstructured-partition-demo
        cd mcp-unstructured-partition-demo
        ```

    </Step>
    <Step>
        Create a virtual environment in the root of the project directory. Then activate the virtual environment:

        ```bash
        # For macOS and Linux:
        uv venv
        source .venv/bin/activate

        # For Windows:
        uv venv
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

        To deactivate and exit the virtual environment at any time, simply run the `deactivate` command:

        ```bash
        deactivate
        ```

    </Step>
    <Step>
        With the virtual environment activated, install the Python SDK for Model Context Protocol and additional code dependencies:

        ```bash
        uv add "mcp[cli]" "unstructured-client>=0.30.6" dotenv
        ```

    </Step>
    <Step>
        In the root of the project directory, create a new Python file. This example names the file `doc_processor.py`. 
        Then add the following code to this new `doc_processor.py` file.

        In the following code, replace `<absolute-path-to-local-directory>` with the absolute path to the local directory where you want 
        Unstructured to store the processed files' content. Be sure that this local directory exists before you run the code.

        ```python
        import os
        from dotenv import load_dotenv
        import json
        from unstructured_client import UnstructuredClient

        ```

    </Step>
    <Step>
        In the root of the project directory, create a new file named `.env`. 
        Then add the following code to this new `.env` file, replacing `<your-unstructured-api-key>` with your Unstructured API key:

        ```text
        UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY="<your-unstructured-api-key>"
        ```

    </Step>
</Steps>
 
## Step 2: Configure Claude for Desktop to use the MCP server

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Open the Claude for Desktop App configuration file from the following location, for example by using Visual Studio Code:

        ```text
        # For macOS or Linux:
        code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

        # For Windows:
        code $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
        ```

    </Step>
    <Step>
        Add the following code to the `claude_desktop_config.json` file, and then save the file.

        In this file:

        - `"unstructured-partition-mcp"` must match the value that you set in `mcp = FastMCP("unstructured-partition-mcp" ...` in the `doc_processor.py` file.
        - "Absolute path to" `uv` must be the absolute path to the `uv` executable on your local machine.
        - "Absolute path to project directory" must be the absolute path to the project directory.
        - `mcp-unstructured-partition-demo` must match the name of the project directory that you created.
        - `"doc_processor.py"` must match the name of the Python file that you created for the MCP server.

        For macOS or Linux:

        ```json
        {
            "mcpServers": {
                "unstructured-partition-mcp": {
                    "command": "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/uv",
                    "args": [
                        "--directory",
                        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PROJECT/DIRECTORY/mcp-unstructured-partition-demo/",
                        "run",
                        "doc_processor.py"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
        ```

        For Windows:

        ```json
        {
            "mcpServers": {
                "unstructured-partition-mcp": {
                    "command": "C:\\ABSOLUTE\\PATH\\TO\\uv",
                    "args": [
                        "--directory",
                        "C:\\ABSOLUTE\\PATH\\TO\\PROJECT\\DIRECTORY\\mcp-unstructured-partition-demo\\",
                        "run",
                        "doc_processor.py"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
        ```

    </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Run the MCP server and call it from Claude for Desktop

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Start Claude for Desktop. If it is already running, restart it.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Ask the following question in the chat window, replacing `<absolute-path-to-local-file>` with the absolute path to the local file that you 
        want Unstructured to process.

        <Note>
            This walkthrough has been tested with small files (less than 400 KB), due to Claude for Desktop's hard timeout limit of 60 seconds for MCP server responses.

            Larger files might take longer for Unstructured to process, and Claude for Desktop might time out before such files are fully processed. 
        </Note>

        ```text
        Process the document at <absolute-path-to-local-file>
        ```

        Claude for Desktop responds with information about the processed document.
        
        You can find the processed file's content in the path that you specified for `PROCESSED_FILES_FOLDER` in the MCP server's `doc_processor.py` file.
    </Step>
