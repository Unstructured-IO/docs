title: SharePoint event triggers
---

You can use SharePoint events, such as adding new files to&mdash;or updating existing files within&mdash;SharePoint document libraries, to automatically run Unstructured ETL+ workflows 
that rely on those document libraries as sources. This enables a no-touch approach to having Unstructured automatically process new and updated files in SharePoint document libraries as they are added or updated.

This example shows how to automate this process by adding a custom [Power Automate](https://www.microsoft.com/power-platform/products/power-automate) flow to your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 account. This flow runs 
whenever a new or updated file is detected in the specified SharePoint document library. This flow then calls the [Unstructured Workflow Endpoint](/api-reference/workflow/overview) to automatically run the 
specified corresponding Unstructured ETL+ workflow within your Unstructured account.

<Note>
    This example uses a custom Power Automate flow that you create and maintain. 
    Any issues with file detection, timing, or flow invocation could be related to your custom flow, 
    rather than with Unstructured. If you are getting unexpected or no results, be sure to check your custom 
    flow's run history first for any informational and error messages.

## Requirements

import GetStartedSimpleApiOnly from '/snippets/general-shared-text/get-started-simple-api-only.mdx'

To use this example, you will need the following:

- A Microsoft 365 or Office 365 Business or enterprise plan that includes SharePoint Online, OneDrive, and Power Automate. 
  [Shop for business plans](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/compare-all-microsoft-365-business-products). 
  [Shop for enterprise plans](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft365-plans-and-pricing). 

- A Power Automate Premium license. [Learn how](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/power-automate-licensing/buy-licenses).

- An Unstructured account, and an Unstructured API key for your account, as follows:

  <GetStartedSimpleApiOnly />

- The Unstructured Workflow Endpoint URL for your account, as follows:

  1. In the Unstructured UI, click **API Keys** on the sidebar.<br/>
  2. Note the value of the **Unstructured Workflow Endpoint** field.

- A SharePoint source connector in your Unstructured account. [Learn how](/ui/sources/sharepoint). 
- Some available [destination connector](/ui/destinations/overview) in your Unstructured account.
- A workflow that uses the preceding source and destination connectors. [Learn how](/ui/workflows).

## Step 1: Create an app registration

In this step, you create an app registration in Microsoft Entra ID to access the Azure key vault that you will create in the next step.

1. Sign in to your [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. In the **Search resources, services, and docs** box, enter **App registrations**, and then in the list of **Services**, click **App registrations**.
3. Click **+ New registration**.
4. Enter some **Name** for the app registration.
5. For **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
6. For **Redirect URI**, select **Web**, and then enter `https://localhost`.
7. Click **Register**.
8. In the sidebar, click **Overview**.
9. Expand **Essentials**, and note the values of the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID** fields.
10. Next to **Client credentials**, click the **Add a certificate or secret** link.
11. On the **Client secrets** tab, click **+ New client secret**.
12. (Optional) Enter some **Description** for the client secret.
13. (Optional) Enter some non-default **Expires** value.
14. Click **Add**.
15. Note the value of the **Value** field. This is the app registration's client secret value. (Do not use the **Secret ID** value.)

## Step 2: Create an Azure key vault

In this step, you store your Unstructured API key in an Azure key vault for your Power Automate flow to access later.

1. With your Azure portal still open from the previous step, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** box, enter **Key vaults**, and then in the list of **Services**, click **Key vaults**.
2. Click **Create**.
3. On the **Basics** tab, set the following key vault settings:

   | Setting | Suggested value | Description |
   |---|---|---|
   | **Subscription** | Your subscription | The Azure subscription within which to create your new key vault. |
   | **Resource Group** | **Create new** | After you click **Create new**, enter some name for the new resource group within which to create your new key vault. |
   | **Key vault name**	| Some globally unique name | Some name that identifies your new key vault. Valid characters are `A`-`Z`, `a`-`z`, `0`-`9`, and `-`. |
   | **Region** | Your preferred region | Select a region that's near you or near other services that your key vault can access. |
   | **Pricing tier** | **Standard** | Choose the pricing tier for your key vault. |

4. Click **Review + create**.
5. Click **Create**.
6. After the deployment is complete, click **Go to resource**.
7. In the sidebar, click **Access control (IAM)**.
8. Click **+ Add > Add role assignment**.
9. On the **Role** tab, in the **Job function roles** list, select **Key Vault Administrator**.
10. Click **Next**.
11. On the **Members** tab, with **Assign access to** set to **User, group, or service principal**, click **+ Select members**.
12. Search for and select the name of the app registration that you created earlier in Step 1.
13. Search also for and select your user account.
14. Click **Select**.
15. Click **Review + assign** twice.
16. In the sidebar, expand **Objects**, and then click **Secrets**.
17. Click **+ Generate/Import**.
18. Enter some **Name** for the secret.
19. For **Secret value**, enter your Unstructured API key value.
20. Click **Create**.

## Step 3: Create a Power Automate flow

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).
2. On the sidebar, click **Create**.
3. In the **Start from blank** area, click **Automated cloud flow**.
4. Enter some **Flow name** for your new flow.
5. For **Search all triggers**, enter `When a file is created or modified (properties only)`, and then click 
   **When a file is created or modified (properties only) (SharePoint)**.
6. Click **Create**.
7. In the flow designer, click the **When a file is created or modified (properties only)** node.
8. On the **Parameters** tab, set the following node properties:

   - For **Site Address**, enter the **Site URL** value of the SharePoint source connector for your workflow.
   - For **Library Name**, enter the **Documents Library** value of the SharePoint source connector for your workflow.
   - (Optional) If you specified a **Path** value for the SharePoint source connector for your workflow, select **Folder** in the **Advanced parameters** list and then select the corresponding folder name.

9. Below the **When a file is created or modified (properties only)** node, click the plus (**Insert a new action...**) button.
10. In the **Search for an action or connector** box, enter `Get secret`, and then under **Azure Key Vault**, select **Get secret**.
11. Set the following node properties:

    - Enter some **Connection name** for the connection.
    - For **Authentication type**, select **Service principal authentication**.
    - For **Client ID**, enter the **Application (client) ID** value of the app registration that you created earlier in Step 1.
    - For **Client secret**, enter the client secret value of the app registration that you created earlier in Step 1.
    - For **Tenant ID**, enter the **Directory (tenant) ID** value of the app registration that you created earlier in Step 1.
    - For **Key vault name**, enter the name of the key vault that you created earlier in Step 2.

12. Click **Create new**.
13. In the **Name of the secret** list, select the name of the secret that you created earlier in Step 2.
14. Below the **Get secret** node, click the plus (**Insert a new action...**) button.
15. In the **Search for an action or connector** box, enter `HTTP`, and then under **HTTP**, select **HTTP**.
16. On the **Parameters** tab, set the following node properties:

    - For **URI**, enter `<unstructured-api-url>/workflows/<workflow-id>/run`, and replace the following placeholders:

      - Replace `<unstructured-api-url>` with your Unstructured Workflow Endpoint value.
      - Replace `<workflow-id>` with the ID of your Unstructured workflow.

      The **URI** should now look similar to the following:

      ```text
      https://platform.unstructuredapp.io/api/v1/workflows/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/run
      ```

    - For **Method**, select **POST**.
    - For **Headers**, enter the following:

      - `accept`, set to `application/json`
      - `unstructured-api-key`, set to your key vault value. To do this, type `/` and select **Insert dynamic content**. 
        Under **Get secret**, select **body/value**.

17. In the top navigation bar, click the disk (**Save**) button.
18. Click **Back** to go to the flow's home page.
19. In the top navigation bar, if the power button shows **Turn on**, click it to change it to **Turn off** (which means that the flow is on and active).

## Step 4: Trigger the flow and view results

1. On a separate tab in your web browser, go to the SharePoint document library that corresponds to both your Unstructured workflow's 
   SharePoint source connector and the Power Automate flow's **When a file is created or modified (properties only)** node.
2. Add or update a file in the document library.
3. On a separate tab in your web browser, in the Unstructured user interface for your account, click **Jobs** on the sidebar.
4. In the list of jobs, click the newly running job for your workflow. It might take a minute or so for the new job to appear in the list.
5. After the job status shows **Finished**, go to your destination location to see the results.

## Step 5 (Optional): Turn off the flow

To stop the Power Automate flow from running automatically, go back to the web browser tab from earlier in Step 3. Then, 
with the flow's home page still open, in the top navigation bar, click the power (**Turn off**) button 
to change it to **Turn on** (which means that the flow is off and inactive).
