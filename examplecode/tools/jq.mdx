title: Query JSON with jq
---

[jq](https://jqlang.org/) is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. You can use `jq` on a local development machine to 
slice, filter, map, and transform the JSON data that Unstructured outputs in much the same ways that tools such as `sed`, `awk`, and `grep` let you work with text.

To get `jq`, see the [Download jq](https://jqlang.org/download/) page.

<Info>
    `jq` is not owned or supported by Unstructured. For questions about `jq`and 
    feature requests for future versions of `jq`, see the [Issues](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/issues) tab of the 
    `jq` repository in GitHub.
</Info>

The following command examples use `jq` with the 
[spring-weather.html.json](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/blob/main/example-docs/spring-weather.html.json) file in the 
**example-docs** directory within the **Unstructured-IO/unstructured** repository in GitHub.

Find the element with a `type` of `Address`, and print the element's `text` field's value.

```bash
jq '.[] 
  | select(.type == "Address") 
  | .text' spring-weather.html.json

# Output:
#
# "Silver Spring, MD 20910"
```

Find all elements with a `type` of `Title`, and print the `text` field of each found element as a string in a JSON array.

```bash
jq '[
  .[] 
  | select(.type == "Title") 
  | .text]' spring-weather.html.json

# Output:
#
# [
#   "News Around NOAA",
#   "National Program",
#   "Are You Weather-Ready for the Spring?",
#   "Weather.gov >",
#   "News Around NOAA > Are You Weather-Ready for the Spring?",
#   "US Dept of Commerce",
#   "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration",
#   "National Weather Service",
#   "News Around NOAA",
#   "1325 East West Highway",
#   "Comments? Questions? Please Contact Us.",
#   "Disclaimer",
#   "Information Quality",
#   "Help",
#   "Glossary",
#   "Privacy Policy",
#   "Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)",
#   "About Us",
#   "Career Opportunities"
# ]
```

Find all elements with a `type` of `Title`. Of these, find the ones that have a `text` field that contains the phrase `Contact Us`, and print the contents of each found element's `metadata.link_urls` field.

```bash
jq '.[] 
  | select(.type == "Title") 
  | select(.text 
  | contains("Contact Us")) 
  | .metadata.link_urls' spring-weather.html.json

# Output:
#
# [
#     "https://www.weather.gov/news/contact"
# ]
```

Find all elements with a `type` of `ListItem`. Of these, find the ones that have a `text` field that contains the phrase `Weather Safety`. 
For each item in `metadata.link_texts`, print the item's value as the key, followed by the matching item in 
`metadata.link_urls` as the value. Trim any leading and trailing whitespace from all values. Wrap the output in a JSON array.

```bash
jq '[
  .[]
  | select(.type == "ListItem")
  | select(.text | test("Weather Safety"; "i"))
  | [.metadata.link_texts, .metadata.link_urls]
  | transpose[]
  | {
      (.[0] | gsub("^\\s+|\\s+$"; "")) : (.[1] | gsub("^\\s+|\\s+$"; ""))
    }
]' spring-weather.html.json
