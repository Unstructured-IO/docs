[Langflow](https://www.langflow.org/) is a visual framework for building multi-agent and RAG applications. 
It is open-source, fully customizable, and works with most LLMs and many vector stores out of the box.

This no-code, hands-on demonstration walks you through creating a Langflow project that enables you to use GPT-4o-mini to chat 
in real time with a PDF document that is processed by Unstructured and has its processed data stored in an 
[Astra DB](https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-astra) vector database.

## Create and run the demonstration project

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create the Langflow project">
        1. Sign in to your Langflow dashboard.
        2. From your dashboard, click **New Project**.
        3. Click **Blank Flow**.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the Unstructured component">
        In this step, you add a component that instructs Unstructured Serverless API services to process a local file or a local directory of files that you specify.
 
        1. On the sidebar, expand **Experimental (Beta)**, and then expand **Loaders**.
        2. Drag the **Unstructured** component onto the designer area.
        3. In the **Unstructured** component, click the box or icon next to **File**, and then select a file or a directory of files for Unstructured to process. This component works only with the file extensions `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.txt`.

           You can select any files that you want. This demonstration uses [the text of the United States Constitution in PDF format](https://constitutioncenter.org/media/files/constitution.pdf), 
           saved to your local development machine.

        4. For **Unstructured.io Serverless API Key**, enter your Unstructured API key value.

           ![Unstructured component](/img/langflow/unstructured-component.png)

        5. Wait until **Saved** appears in the top navigation bar.

           ![Saved message](/img/langflow/saved.png)

    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the OpenAI Embeddings component">
        In this step, you add a component that generates vector embeddings for the processed data that Unstructured outputs.

        1. On the sidebar, expand **Embeddings**, and then drag the **OpenAI Embeddings** component onto the designer area.
        2. In the **OpenAI Embeddings** component, for **Model**, select `text-embedding-3-large`.
        3. For **OpenAI API Key**, enter your OpenAI API key's value.

           ![OpenAI Embeddings component](/img/langflow/openai-embeddings-component.png)

        4. Wait until **Saved** appears in the top navigation bar.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the Astra DB components">
        In this step, you add two components. The first component instructs Astra DB to ingest into the specified Astra DB collection the processed data that Unstructured outputs along 
        with the associated generated vector embeddings. The second component instructs Astra DB to take user-supplied chat messages and perform contextual 
        searches over the ingested data in the specified Astra DB collection, outputting its search results. 

        1. On the sidebar, expand **Vector Stores**, and then drag the **Astra DB** component onto the designer area.
        2. Double-click the **Astra DB** component's title bar, and rename the component to `Astra DB Ingest`.
        3. Repeat these previous two actions to add a second **Astra DB** component, renaming it to `Astra DB RAG`.
        4. In both of these **Astra DB** components, in the **Database** list, select the name of your Astra DB database. Make sure this is the same database name in both components.
        5. In the **Collection** list in both components, select the name of the collection in the database. Make sure this is the same collection name in both components.
        6. In the **Astra DB Application Token** box in both components, enter your Astra DB application token's value. Make sure this is the same application token value in both components.
        7. Connect the **Data** output from the **Unstructured** component to the **Ingest Data** input in the **Astra DB Ingest** component.

           To make the connection, click and hold your mouse pointer inside of the circle next to **Data** in the **Unstructured** component. 
           While holding your mouse pointer, drag it over into the circle next to **Ingest Data** in the **Astra DB Ingest** component. Then 
           release your mouse pointer. A line appears between these two circles.

        8. Connect the **Embeddings** output from the **OpenAI Embeddings** component to the **Embedding or Astra Vectorize** input in the  **Astra DB Ingest** component.

           ![Astra DB component](/img/langflow/astra-db-component.png)

        9. Wait until **Saved** appears in the top navigation bar.
        10. In the title bar of the **Astra DB Ingest** component, click the play icon. This ingests the processed data 
            from Unstructured and the associated generated vector embeddings into the specified Astra DB collection.

            ![Play icon](/img/langflow/build.png)

        11. Wait until **Building** disppears from the top navigation bar, and a green check mark appears next to this play icon. This could take several minutes.
    
            <Note>
                Each time you click the play icon in the **Astra DB Ingest** component, Unstructured reprocesses the specified local 
                file or a local directory. If neither the specified file names or directories nor the specified collection name change, this could result in multiple duplicate records 
                being inserted into the specified Astra DB collection. You should only click the play icon in the **Astra DB Ingest** component when you want to insert new processed data into 
                the specified Astra DB collection.
            </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the Chat Input component">
        In this step, you add a component that takes user-supplied chat messages and sends them as input to Astra DB for contextual searching.

        1. On the sidebar, expand **Inputs**, and then drag the **Chat Input** component onto the designer area.
        2. Connect the **Message** output from the **Chat Input** component to the **Search Input** input in the **Astra DB RAG** component.
        
           ![Chat Input component](/img/langflow/chat-input-component.png)

        3. Wait until **Saved** appears in the top navigation bar.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the Parse Data component">
        In this step, you add a component that takes the Astra DB search results and converts them into plain text, suitable for inclusion in 
        a prompt to a text-based LLM.

        1. On the sidebar, expand **Helpers**, and then drag the **Parse Data** component onto the designer area.
        2. Connect the **Search Results** output from the **Astra DB RAG** component to the **Data** input in the **Parse Data** component.

           ![Parse Data component](/img/langflow/parse-data-component.png)

        3. Wait until **Saved** appears in the top navigation bar.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the Prompt component">
        In this step, you add a component that builds a prompt and then sends it to a text-based LLM.

        1. On the sidebar, expand **Prompts**, and then drag the **Prompt** component onto the designer area.
        2. In the **Prompt** component, next to **Template**, click the box or arrow icon.
        3. In the **Edit Prompt** window, enter the following prompt:

           ```text
           {context}

           ---

           Given the context above, answer the question as best as possible.

           Question: {question}

           Answer: 
           ```

        4. Click **Check & Save**.

           ![Prompt component](/img/langflow/edit-prompt.png)

        5. Connect the **Text** output from the **Parse Data** component to the **context** input in the **Prompt** component.

           ![Connect Prompt component](/img/langflow/connect-prompt-component.png)

        
        6. Connect the **Message** output from the **Chat Input** component to the **question** input in the **Prompt** component.

           <Note>
               You will now have two connections from the **Message** output in the **Chat Input** component:

               - One connection was already made to the **Search Input** input in the **Astra DB RAG** component.
               - Another connection has just now been made to the **question** input in the **Prompt** component.
           </Note>

        7. Wait until **Saved** appears in the top navigation bar.
    </Step>
