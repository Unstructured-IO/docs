The Unstructured Ingest Python library enables you to use Python code to send files in batches to Unstructured for processing, and to tell Unstructured where to deliver the processed data.

<Note>
    The Unstructured Ingest Python library does not work with the Unstructured API.

    For information about the Unstructured API, see the [Unstructured API Overview](/api-reference/workflow/overview).

The following 3-minute video shows how to use the Unstructured Ingest Python library to send multiple PDFs from a local directory in batches to be ingested by Unstructured for processing:

## Getting started

import GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly from '/snippets/general-shared-text/get-started-simple-api-only.mdx';

You can use the Unstructured Ingest Python library to process files locally, or you can use the Ingest Python library to send files in batches to Unstructured for processing.

Local processing does not use an Unstructured API key or API URL.

Using the Ingest Python library to send files in batches to Unstructured for processing is more robust, and usage is billed to you on a pay-as-you-go basis. Usage requires an Unstructured API key and API URL, as follows:

<GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly />

3. The default Unstructured API URL for Unstructured Ingest is `https://api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general`, which is the API URL for the [Unstructured Partition Endpoint](/api-reference/partition/overview).
   You must specify this API URL in your 
   code only if you are not using this default, for example, if you are calling a version of the Unstructured API that is hosted on your own compute infrastructure. 

<Note>
  If the Unstructured API is hosted on your own compute infrastructure, the process
  for generating Unstructured API keys, and the Unstructured API URL that you use, are different. 
  For details, contact Unstructured Sales at 
  [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).

## Installation

One approach to get started quickly with the Unstructured Ingest Python library is to install Python and then run the following command:

```bash
pip install unstructured-ingest
```

This default installation option enables the ingestion of plain text files, HTML, XML, JSON and emails that do not require any extra dependencies. This default option also enables you to specify local source and destination locations.

import AdditionalIngestDependencies from '/snippets/general-shared-text/ingest-dependencies.mdx';

<AdditionalIngestDependencies />

For additional installation options, see the [Unstructured Ingest Python library](/open-source/ingestion/python-ingest) in the [Ingest](/open-source/ingestion/overview) section.

<Info>To migrate from older, deprecated versions of the Ingest Python library that used `pip install unstructured`, see the [migration guide](/open-source/ingestion/overview#migration-guide).</Info>

## Usage

For example, to use the Unstructured Ingest Python library to ingest files from a local source (input) location and to deliver the processed data to an Azure Storage account destination (output) location:

import AzureAPIPyV2 from '/snippets/destination_connectors/azure.v2.py.mdx';

<CodeGroup>
  <AzureAPIPyV2 />
</CodeGroup>

To learn how to use the Unstructured Ingest Python library to work with a specific source (input) and destination (output) location, see the Python code examples for the [source](/open-source/ingestion/source-connectors/overview) and [destination](/open-source/ingestion/destination-connectors/overview) connectors that are available for you to choose from.

See also the [ingest configuration](/open-source/ingestion/ingest-configuration/overview) settings that enable you to further control how batches are sent and processed.

## Migration guide

The Unstructured Ingest Python library introduced breaking changes in version 0.7.0 as follows:

- The library has moved the calling pattern (formerly commonly referred to as "v2") up one level in the package. If you are using this calling pattern 
  in your existing code, beginning with version 0.7.0 you must remove `.v2` from your related `from...import` statements. For example, if you previously had statments 
  such as these:

  ```python
  from unstructured_ingest.v2.pipeline.pipeline import Pipeline
  from unstructured_ingest.v2.interfaces import ProcessorConfig
  ```
  
  Beginning with version 0.7.0, you must change to these by removing `.v2`:

  ```python
  from unstructured_ingest.pipeline.pipeline import Pipeline
  from unstructured_ingest.interfaces import ProcessorConfig
  ```

  If you do not make these changes beginning with version 0.7.0, your existing code will no longer work. To run your existing code 
  without making these changes, you must pin your installed library version to 0.6.4 or earlier.

- The earlier calling pattern (commonly referred to as "v1") has been deprecated and removed from the library and will no longer work beginning with version 0.7.0. If you are using this earlier "v1" calling pattern in your code, you must 
  either manually migrate your code to the new calling pattern (formerly commonly referred to as "v2"), or pin your installed library version to 0.6.4 or earlier to keep using this earlier "v1" calling pattern.

  To learn how to use the new calling pattern (formerly commonly referred to as "v2"), see the code examples in the 
  [source connectors](/open-source/ingestion/source-connectors/overview) and [destination connectors](/open-source/ingestion/destination-connectors/overview) documentation.
