Now call the Unstructured Ingest CLI or the Unstructured Ingest Python library.  The source connector can be any of the ones supported. 

The following 3-minute video shows how to use the Unstructured Ingest Python library to send multiple PDFs from a local directory in batches to be ingested by Unstructured for processing:

<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"

  title="YouTube video player"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

This example uses the local source connector.

This example sends files to Unstructured for processing by default. To process files locally instead, see the instructions at the end of this page.
