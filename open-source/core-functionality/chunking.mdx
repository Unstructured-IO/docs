title: Chunking
description: Chunking functions in `unstructured` use metadata and document elements detected with `partition` functions to post-process elements into more useful "chunks" for uses cases such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Chunking Basics

Chunking in `unstructured` differs from other chunking mechanisms you may be familiar with. Typical approaches start with the text extracted from the document and form chunks based on plain-text features, character sequences like `"\n\n"` or `"\n"` that might indicate a paragraph boundary or list-item boundary.

Because `unstructured` uses specific knowledge about each document format to partition the document into semantic units (document elements), we only need to resort to text-splitting when a single element exceeds the desired maximum chunk size. Except in that case, all chunks contain one or more whole elements, preserving the coherence of semantic units established during partitioning.

A few concepts about chunking are worth introducing before discussing the details.

*   Chunking is performed on _document elements_. It is a separate step performed _after_ partitioning, on the elements produced by partitioning. (Although it can be combined with partitioning in a single step.)
    
*   In general, chunking _combines_ consecutive elements to form chunks as large as possible without exceeding the maximum chunk size.
    
*   A single element that by itself exceeds the maximum chunk size is divided into two or more chunks using text-splitting.
    
*   Chunking produces a sequence of `CompositeElement`, `Table`, or `TableChunk` elements. Each “chunk” is an instance of one of these three types.
    

## Chunking Options

The following options are available to tune chunking behaviors. These are keyword arguments that can be used in a partitioning or chunking function call. All these options have defaults and need only be specified when a non-default setting is required. Specific chunking strategies (such as “by-title”) may have additional options.

*   `max_characters: int (default=500)` - the hard maximum size for a chunk. No chunk will exceed this number of characters. A single element that by itself exceeds this size will be divided into two or more chunks using text-splitting.
    
*   `new_after_n_chars: int (default=max_characters)` - the “soft” maximum size for a chunk. A chunk that already exceeds this number of characters will not be extended, even if the next element would fit without exceeding the specified hard maximum. This can be used in conjunction with `max_characters` to set a “preferred” size, like “I prefer chunks of around 1000 characters, but I’d rather have a chunk of 1500 (max\_characters) than resort to text-splitting”. This would be specified with `(..., max_characters=1500, new_after_n_chars=1000)`.
    
*   `overlap: int (default=0)` - only when using text-splitting to break up an oversized chunk, include this number of characters from the end of the prior chunk as a prefix on the next. This can mitigate the effect of splitting the semantic unit represented by the oversized element at an arbitrary position based on text length.
    
*   `overlap_all: bool (default=False)` - also apply overlap between “normal” chunks, not just when text-splitting to break up an oversized element. Because normal chunks are formed from whole elements that each have a clean semantic boundary, this option may “pollute” normal chunks. You’ll need to decide based on your use-case whether this option is right for you.
    

## Chunking

Chunking can be performed as part of partitioning or as a separate step after partitioning:

### Specifying a chunking strategy while partitioning

Chunking can be performed as part of partitioning by specifying a value for the `chunking_strategy` argument. The current options are `basic` and `by-title` (described below).

```python
from unstructured.partition.html import partition_html

chunks = partition_html(url=url, chunking_strategy="basic")

```


### Calling a chunking function

Chunking can also be performed separately from partitioning by calling a chunking function directly. This may be convenient, for example, when tuning chunking parameters. Chunking is typically faster than partitioning, especially when OCR or inference is used, so a faster feedback loop is possible by doing these separately:

```python
from unstructured.chunking.basic import chunk_elements
from unstructured.partition.html import partition_html

url = "https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-27-2023-0"
elements = partition_html(url=url)
chunks = chunk_elements(elements)

# -- OR --

from unstructured.chunking.title import chunk_by_title

chunks = chunk_by_title(elements)

for chunk in chunks:
    print(chunk)
    print("\n\n" + "-"*80)
    input()

```


## Chunking Strategies

There are currently two chunking strategies, _basic_ and _by\_title_. The `by_title` strategy shares most behaviors with
the basic strategy so we'll describe the baseline strategy first:

## Recovering Chunk Elements

In general, a chunk consolidates multiple document elements to maximally fill a chunk of the desired size. Information is naturally lost in this consolidation, for example which element a portion of the text came from and certain metadata like page-number and coordinates which cannot always be resolved to a single value.

The original elements combined to make a chunk can be accessed using the .metadata.orig\_elements field on the chunk:

```python
>>> elements = [
...     Title("Lorem Ipsum"),
...     NarrativeText("Lorem ipsum dolor sit."),
... ]
>>> chunk = chunk_elements(elements)[0]
>>> print(chunk.text)
'Lorem Ipsum\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit.'
>>> print(chunk.metadata.orig_elements)
[Title("Lorem Ipsum"), NarrativeText("Lorem ipsum dolor sit.")]

```


These elements will contain all their original metadata so can be used to access metadata that cannot reliably be consolidated, for example:


```python python
>>> {e.metadata.page_number for e in chunk.metadata.orig_elements}
{2, 3}

```


```
>>> [e.metadata.coordinates for e in chunk.metadata.orig_elements]
[<CoordinatesMetadata ...>, <CoordinatesMetadata ...>, ...]

```


```
>>> [
    e.metadata.image_path
    for e in chunk.metadata.orig_elements
    if e.metadata.image_path is not None
]
['/tmp/lorem.jpg', '/tmp/ipsum.png']

```
