Follow these steps to run the Unstructured open source library inside a Docker container.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install and run Docker">
        If you do not have Docker already installed and running, you can install and run a tool such as Docker Desktop, which is 
        available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. Learn how to install and run:
        
        - [Docker Desktop on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)
        - [Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)
        - [Docker Desktop on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Pull the Unstructured Docker image">
        <Info>If you are an experienced Docker user, you plan to parse only a single type of data, and you want to accelerate the image-building process, you can [build your own Docker image](#building-your-own-docker-image) instead of pulling the latest prebuilt image.</Info>

                    The following steps are for AMD64-based systems.

                    If you are using an ARM64-based system (such as Apple Silicon), follow the instructions on the **Docker CLI** tab in this step instead.
                </Note>  

                1. In your Docker Desktop UI's search box, enter `downloads.unstructured.io/unstructured-io/unstructured:latest`.
                2. On the **Images** tab, next to **unstructured-io/unstructured**, click **Pull**.

                To list the available images on your machine, in the sidebar, click **Images**.

                To remove this image from your machine at any time, click the trash can (**Delete**) icon next to the image in the 
                list of available images.
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Docker CLI">
                From your terminal or command prompt, run the following command.

                <Tip>If you have the Docker Desktop UI running, you can click the **Terminal** button in the UI's lower right corner to run a Docker CLI session from within the Docker Desktop UI.</Tip>

                For AMD64-based systems, run the following command:

                   processed data is written as a JSON file named `layout-parser-paper-output.json` in that same directory:

                   After the last call finishes running, exit the Python interpreter, and then print the contents of the JSON file to the terminal:

        </Tabs>

    <Step title="Interact with the Unstructured open source library by running code outside the container">
        You can also interact with the Unstructured open source library by running code that is on the 
        same machine as the running container but not within the container itself. To do this, you can 
        use the Docker CLI to create a container that mounts the local directory containing the 
        code into the container itself, and then run that code from the container.

        1. Run one of the following commands, replacing the following placeholders with the appropriate values:

           - Replace `<host-path>` with the path to the directory containing your code, for example `/Users/<username>/my_example_code/`.
           - Replace `<container-path>` with the path to some directory within the container to mount `<host-path>` into, for example `/app/my_example_code/`. If 
             `<container-path>` does not already exist, it will be created at the same time that the container is created.
           - Replace `<container-name>` with some name for your container, such as `unstructured_mount`. 
           
           For AMD64-based systems, run the following command:

           ```bash
           # The AMD64 platform is the default.
           docker run -dt -v <host-path>:<container-path>--name <container-name> downloads.unstructured.io/unstructured-io/unstructured:latest

           # Or, to explicitly specify the AMD64 platform:
           docker run -dt -v <host-path>:<container-path> --platform=linux/amd64 --name <container-name> downloads.unstructured.io/unstructured-io/unstructured:latest
           ```

           For ARM64-based systems (such as Apple Silicon), run the following command instead:

           ```bash
           docker run -dt -v <host-path>:<container-path> --platform=linux/arm64 --name <container-name> downloads.unstructured.io/unstructured-io/unstructured:latest
           ```

        2. Start a terminal session inside the container by running the following command, replacing `<container-name>` with the name of your container, such as `unstructured_mount`:

           ```bash
           docker exec -it <container-name> bash
           ```

        3. Add `<container-path>` to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable within the container by running the following commands, 
           replacing `<container-path>` with the path to the target directory within the container:

           ```bash
           PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:<container-path>"
           export PYTHONPATH
           ```

        4. Run Unstructured open source library calls, referencing your code from `<container-path>`.

           For example, if you have a file named `main.py` in `<host-path>`that contains the four commands following `>>>` from the previous step, 
           you can run it as follows, replacing `<container-path>` with the path to the target directory within the container:

           ```bash
           python <container-path>/main.py
           ```

           To print the contents of the JSON file to the terminal, run the following command:

           ```bash
           cat /app/example-docs/pdf/layout-parser-paper-output.json
           ```
           
        5. To exit the terminal session, run the following command, or press `Ctrl+D`:

           ```bash
           exit
           ``` 
    </Step>
    <Step title="Stop running the container">
        If you do not need the keep running the container, you can stop it as follows:

            <Tab title="Docker Desktop UI">
                1. In the Docker Desktop UI, in the sidebar, click **Containers**.
                2. Next to your container, click the square (**Stop**) icon.
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Docker CLI">
                Run the following command, replacing `<container-name>` with the name of your container, such as `unstructured` or `unstructured_mount`:

                ```bash
                docker stop <container-name>
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Building your own Docker image

You can build your own Docker image instead of pulling the latest prebuilt image. 
If you only plan to parse a single type of data, you can accelerate the 
build process by excluding certain packages or requirements needed for other data types. Refer to the 
[Dockerfile](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/blob/main/Dockerfile) to determine which lines 
are necessary for your requirements.

```bash
make docker-build

# Start a Bash shell inside of the running Docker container.
make docker-start-bash
```
