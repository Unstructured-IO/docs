Follow these steps to run the Unstructured open source library inside a Docker container.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install and run Docker">
        If you do not have Docker already installed and running, you can install and run a tool such as Docker Desktop, which is 
        available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. Learn how to install and run:
        
        - [Docker Desktop on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)
        - [Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)
        - [Docker Desktop on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Pull the Unstructured Docker image">
        <Info>If you are an experienced Docker user, you plan to parse only a single type of data, and you want to accelerate the image-building process, you can [build your own Docker image](#building-your-own-docker-image) instead of pulling the latest prebuilt image.</Info>

                    The following steps are for AMD64-based systems.

                    If you are using an ARM64-based system (such as Apple Silicon), follow the instructions on the **Docker CLI** tab in this step instead.
                </Note>  

                1. In your Docker Desktop UI's search box, enter `downloads.unstructured.io/unstructured-io/unstructured:latest`.
                2. On the **Images** tab, next to **unstructured-io/unstructured**, click **Pull**.

                To list the available images on your machine, in the sidebar, click **Images**.

                To remove this image from your machine at any time, click the trash can (**Delete**) icon next to the image in the 
                list of available images.
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Docker CLI">
                From your terminal or command prompt, run the following command.

                <Tip>If you have the Docker Desktop UI running, you can click the **Terminal** button in the UI's lower right corner to run a Docker CLI session from within the Docker Desktop UI.</Tip>

                For AMD64-based systems, run the following command:

                ```bash
                # The AMD64 platform is the default.
                docker pull downloads.unstructured.io/unstructured-io/unstructured:latest

                # Or, to explicitly specify the AMD64 platform:
                docker pull --platform=linux/amd64 downloads.unstructured.io/unstructured-io/unstructured:latest
                ```

                For ARM64-based systems (such as Apple Silicon), run the following command instead:

                ```bash
                docker pull --platform=linux/arm64 downloads.unstructured.io/unstructured-io/unstructured:latest
                ```

                To list the available images on your machine, run the following command:
                
                ```bash
                docker images
                ```

                To remove this image from your machine at any time, run the following command:
                
                ```bash
                docker rmi downloads.unstructured.io/unstructured-io/unstructured:latest

## Building your own Docker image

You can build your own Docker image instead of pulling the latest prebuilt image. 
If you only plan to parse a single type of data, you can accelerate the 
build process by excluding certain packages or requirements needed for other data types. Refer to the 
[Dockerfile](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/blob/main/Dockerfile) to determine which lines 
are necessary for your requirements.

```bash
make docker-build

# Start a Bash shell inside of the running Docker container.
make docker-start-bash
```
