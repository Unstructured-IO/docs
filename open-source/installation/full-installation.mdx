**Basic Usage**

For a complete set of extras catering to every document type, use:

```bash
pip install "unstructured[all-docs]"
```

To install `unstructured`, you'll also need to install the following system dependencies: libmagic, poppler-utils, libreoffice, pandoc, and tesseract.
Instruction details for these dependencies will vary by operating system. We recommend
running `unstructured` from the officially supported Docker image, which has these dependencies
installed already.
