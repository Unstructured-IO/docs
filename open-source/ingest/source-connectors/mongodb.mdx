The upstream connector can be any of the ones supported, but for convenience here, showing a sample command using the upstream local connector.

import MongoDBSh from '/snippets/source_connectors/mongodb.sh.mdx';
import MongoDBPy from '/snippets/source_connectors/mongodb.py.mdx';

<CodeGroup>

  <MongoDBSh />

  <MongoDBPy />

</CodeGroup>

For a full list of the options the CLI accepts check `unstructured-ingest <upstream connector> mongodb --help`.

NOTE: Keep in mind that you will need to have all the appropriate extras and dependencies for the file types of the documents contained in your data storage platform if youâ€™re running this locally. You can find more information about this in the [installation guide](/open-source/installation/overview).
