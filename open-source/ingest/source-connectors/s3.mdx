title: S3 
description: Connect S3 to your preprocessing pipeline, and batch process all your documents using `unstructured-ingest` to store structured outputs locally on your filesystem.
---

First you’ll need to install the S3 dependencies as shown here.

```bash
pip install "unstructured[s3]"

```


## Run Locally

import S3Sh from '/snippets/source_connectors/s3.sh.mdx';
import S3Py from '/snippets/source_connectors/s3.py.mdx';

<CodeGroup>

  <S3Sh />

  <S3Py />

</CodeGroup>


## Run via the API

You can also use upstream connectors with the `unstructured` API. For this you’ll need to use the `--partition-by-api` flag and pass in your API key with `--api-key`.

import S3APISh from '/snippets/source_connectors/s3_api.sh.mdx';
import S3APIPy from '/snippets/source_connectors/s3_api.py.mdx';

<CodeGroup>

  <S3APISh />

  <S3APIPy />

</CodeGroup>


Additionally, you will need to pass the `--partition-endpoint` if you’re running the API locally. You can find more information about the `unstructured` API [here](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-api).

For a full list of the options the CLI accepts check `unstructured-ingest s3 --help`.

NOTE: Keep in mind that you will need to have all the appropriate extras and dependencies for the file types of the documents contained in your data storage platform if you’re running this locally. You can find more information about this in the [installation guide](/open-source/installation/overview).
