title: Extract images and tables from documents
---

## Task

You want to get, decode, and show elements, such as images and tables, that are embedded in a PDF document.

## Approach

Extract the Base64-encoded representation of specific elements, such as images and tables, in the document. 
For each of these extracted elements, decode the Base64-encoded representation of the element into its original visual representation 
and then show it.

## To run this example

You will need a document that is one of the document types supported by the `extract_image_block_types` argument. 
See the `extract_image_block_types` entry in [API Parameters](/api-reference/partition/legacy-api/api-parameters). 
This example uses a PDF file with embedded images and tables.

import SharedAPIKeyURL from '/snippets/general-shared-text/api-key-url.mdx';
import ExtractImageBlockTypesIngestPy from '/snippets/how-to-api/extract_image_block_types_ingest.py.mdx';

## Code

For the [Unstructured Ingest Python library](/open-source/ingestion/python-ingest), you can use the standard Python 
[json.load](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.load) function to load into a Python dictionary the contents of a JSON 
file that the Ingest Python library outputs after the processing is complete.
