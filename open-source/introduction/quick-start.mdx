title: Quickstart
---

In this quickstart, you use the [Unstructured open source library](/open-source/introduction/overview) 
([GitHub](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured), 
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/unstructured/)) along with Python on your local development machine to partition a PDF file into a standard set of 
[Unstructured document elements and metadata](/open-source/concepts/document-elements). You can use these elements and 
metadata as input into your RAG applications, AI agents, model fine-tuning tasks, and more.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Prerequisites">
        To complete this quickstart, you need:

        - A Python virtual environment manager is recommended to manage your Python code dependencies. 
          This quickstart uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for managing virtual environments and 
          [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) as the virtual environment type. Installation and 
          use of `uv` and `venv` are described in the following steps. 
          However, `uv` and `venv` are not required to use the Unstructured open source library.
        - Python 3.9 or higher. You can use `uv` to install Python if needed, as described in the following steps.
        - A PDF file on your local machine. If you do not have a PDF file available, this quickstart provides a sample PDF file named 
          `layout-parser-paper.pdf` that you can download in a later step. (The Unstructured open source library provides 
          [support for additional file types](/open-source/introduction/supported-file-types) as well.)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install uv">
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="macOS, Linux">
                To use `curl` with `sh`:

                ```bash
                curl -fsSL https://get.uv.dev | bash
                ```

                To use `wget` with `sh` instead:

                ```bash
                wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
                ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Windows">
                To use PowerShell with `irm` to download the script and run it with `iex`:

                ```powershell
                powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        To install `uv` by using other approaches such as PyPI, Homebrew, or WinGet, 
        see [Installing uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install Python">
        `uv` will detect and use Python if you already have it installed. 
        To view a list of installed Python versions, run the following command:

        ```bash
        uv python list
        ```
        
        If, however, you do not already have Python installed, you can install a version of Python for use with `uv` 
        by running the following command. For example, this command installs Python 3.12 for use with `uv`:
    
        ```bash
        uv python install 3.12
        ```        
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a uv project">
        To use `uv` to create a project, switch to the directory on your development machine where you want to 
        create the project, and then run the following command:

        ```bash
        uv init
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a venv virtual environment">
        From your project directory, use `uv` to create a virtual environment with `venv` by running the following command:

        ```bash
        # Create the virtual environment by using the current Python version:
        uv venv

        # Or, if you want to use a specific Python version:
        uv venv --python 3.12
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Activate the virtual environment">
        To activate the virtual environment, run one of the following commands:
        
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="macOS, Linux">
                - For `bash` or `zsh`, run `source .venv/bin/activate`
                - For `fish`, run `source .venv/bin/activate.fish`
                - For `csh` or `tcsh`, run `source .venv/bin/activate.csh`
                - For `pwsh`, run `.venv/bin/Activate.ps1`
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Windows">
                - For `cmd.exe`, run `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
                - For `PowerShell`, run `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
        
        To deactivate the virtual environment at any time, run `deactivate`.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install the Unstructured open source library">
        With the virtual environment activated, install the Unstructured open source library by running the following command:

        ```bash
        uv add unstructured
        ```

        The preceding command supports plain text files (`.txt`), HTML files (`.html`), XML files (`.xml`), and emails (`.eml`, `.msg`, and `.p7s`) without any additional dependencies.

        To work with other file types, you must also install these dependencies, as follows, replacing `<extra>` with the appropriate extra for the target file type:

        ```bash
        uv add "unstructured[<extra>]"
        ```

        The following file type extras are available:

        - `all-docs` (for all supported file types in this list)
        - `csv` (for `.csv` files only)
        - `docx` (for `.doc` and `.docx` files only)
        - `epub` (for `.epub` files only)
        - `image` (for all supported image file types: `.bmp`, `.heic`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, and `.tiff`)
        - `md` (for `.md` files only)
        - `odt` (for `.odt` files only)
        - `org` (for `.org` files only)
        - `pdf` (for `.pdf` files only)
        - `pptx` (for `.ppt` and `.pptx` files only)
        - `rst` (for `.rst` files only)
        - `rtf` (for `.rtf` files only)
        - `tsv` (for `.tsv` files only)
        - `xlsx` (for `.xls` and `.xlsx` files only)

        As this quickstart uses a sample PDF file, run the following command:
        
        ```bash
        uv add "unstructured[pdf]"
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install system dependencies">
        You maximum compatibility, you should also install the following system dependencies:

        - [libmagic-dev](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/libmagic.3.html) (for filetype detection)
        - [poppler-utils](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) and [tesseract-ocr](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) (for images and PDFs), and `tesseract-lang` (for additional language support)
        - [libreoffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/libreoffice/) (for Microsoft Office documents)
        - [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) (for `.epub`, `.odt`, and `.rtf` files. For `.rtf` files, you must have version 2.14.2 or newer. Running [this script](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/blob/main/scripts/install-pandoc.sh) will install the correct version for you.)

        Installation instructured for these system dependencies vary by operating system type. For details, follow the preceding links or see your 
        operating system's documentation.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Download the sample PDF file">
        Download the sample PDF file named `layout-parser-paper.pdf` from the following location to your local development machine:

        [https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/tree/main/example-docs/pdf](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/tree/main/example-docs/pdf)    
    
        (You can also use any other PDF file that you want to work with instead of this sample file, if you prefer.)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the Python code">
        In the project's `main.py` file, add the following Python code, replacing `<path/to>` with the 
        path to the `layout-parser-paper.pdf` file that you downloaded to your local development machine.

        (If you want to use a different PDF file, replace `layout-parser-paper` with the name of that PDF file instead.)
        
        ```python
        from unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf
        from unstructured.staging.base import elements_to_json

        file_path = "<path/to>"
        base_file_name = "layout-parser-paper"

        def main():
            elements = partition_pdf(filename=f"{file_path}/{base_file_name}.pdf")
            elements_to_json(elements=elements, filename=f"{file_path}/{base_file_name}-output.json")

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the Python code">
        Run the preceding Python code by running the following command:

        ```bash
        uv run main.py
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="View the output">
        View the Unstructured elements and metadata that were generated by opening the `layout-parser-paper-output.json` file in your editor. This file will be in 
        the location as the original `layout-parser-paper.pdf` file.

        (If you used a different PDF file, the output file will be named `<your-file-name>-output.json` instead.)
    </Step>
</Steps>
