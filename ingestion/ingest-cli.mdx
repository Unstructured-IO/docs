title: Process files in batches by using the Unstructured Ingest CLI
sidebarTitle: Ingest CLI
---

The Unstructured Ingest CLI enables you to use command-line scripts to send files in batches to Unstructured for processing, and to tell Unstructured where to deliver the processed data. [Learn more](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-cli).

<Note>
    The Unstructured Ingest CLI does not work with the Unstructured API.

    For information about the Unstructured API, see the [Unstructured API Overview](/api-reference/workflow/overview).
</Note>

## Getting started

import GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly from '/snippets/general-shared-text/get-started-simple-api-only.mdx';

You can use the Unstructured Ingest CLI to process files locally, or you can use the Ingest CLI to send files in batches to Unstructured for processing.

Local processing does not use an Unstructured API key or API URL.

Using the Ingest CLI to send files in batches to Unstructured for processing is more robust, and usage is billed to you on a pay-as-you-go basis. Usage requires an Unstructured API key and API URL, as follows:

<GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly />

3. The default Unstructured API URL for Unstructured Ingest is `https://api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general`, which is the API URL for the [Unstructured Partition Endpoint](/api-reference/partition/overview).
   You must specify this API URL in your 
   scripts only if you are not using this default, for example, if you are calling a version of the Unstructured API that is hosted on your own compute infrastructure.

<Note>
  If the Unstructured API is hosted on your own compute infrastructure, the process
  for generating Unstructured API keys, and the Unstructured API URL that you use, are different. 
  For details, contact Unstructured Sales at 
  [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).
</Note>

## Installation 

One approach to get started quickly with the Unstructured Ingest CLI is to install Python and then run the following command:

```bash
pip install unstructured-ingest
```

This default installation option enables the ingestion of plain text files, HTML, XML, JSON and emails that do not require any extra dependencies. This default option also enables you to specify local source and destination locations.

import AdditionalIngestDependencies from '/snippets/general-shared-text/ingest-dependencies.mdx';

<AdditionalIngestDependencies />

For additional installation options, see [Unstructured Ingest CLI](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-cli) in the [Ingest](/ingestion/overview) section.

<Info>To migrate from older, deprecated versions of the Ingest CLI that used `pip install unstructured`, see the [migration guide](/ingestion/overview#migration-guide).</Info>

## Usage

To call the Unstructured Ingest CLI, follow this calling pattern, where:

- `<source>` is the command name for one of the available [source](/ingestion/source-connectors/overview) (input) connectors, such as `local` for a local source location, `azure` for an Azure Storage account source, `s3` for an Amazon S3 bucket source, and so on.
- `<destination>` is the command name for one of the available [destination](/ingestion/destination-connectors/overview) (output) connectors, such as `local` for a local destination, `azure` for an Azure Storage account destination, `s3` for an Amazon S3 bucket destination, and so on.
- `<setting>` is one or more command-line options for specifying how and where Unstructured will ingest the files from the `<source>`, or how and where to deliver the processed data to the `<destination>`. 

```bash CLI
#!/usr/bin/env bash

unstructured-ingest \
  <source> \
    --<setting1> <value1> \
    --<setting2> <value2> \
    --<settingN> <valueN> \
  <destination> \
    --<setting1> <value1> \
    --<setting2> <value2> \
    --<settingN> <valueN>
```

To learn how to use the Unstructured Ingest CLI to work with a specific source (input) and destination (output) location, see the CLI script examples for the [source](/ingestion/source-connectors/overview) and [destination](/ingestion/destination-connectors/overview) connectors that are available for you to choose from.

See also the [ingest configuration](/ingestion/ingest-configuration/overview) settings for command-line options that enable you to further control how batches are sent and processed.
