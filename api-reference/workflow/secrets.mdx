title: Secrets
---

When you make calls to the [Unstructured Workflow Endpoint](/api-reference/workflow/overview), you might need to include a 
third-party secret as part of the request. These third-party secrets typically include things like API keys, passwords, 
contents of key files, and other sensitive information that are required when creating 
[source connectors](/api-reference/workflow/source-connectors) and [destination connectors](/api-reference/workflow/destination-connectors).

Instead of sending these secrets to Unstructured programmatically in plain text, which presents a security risk, you must instead follow Unstructured's 
process for more securely handling each secret as follows:

1. Get the private key for your Unstructured user account.
2. Use this private key to encrypt the target secret locally.
3. Register the encrypted secret with your Unstructured account. Unstructured returns a registration code that represents the encrypted secret 
   that was registered.
4. Whenever you need to include the target secret in a call to the Unstructured Workflow Endpoint, specify the registration code instead 
   of the target secret.

If the Unstructured Workflow Endpoint expects a registration code instead of a plain-text secret, and you do not provide a registration code 
or provide the wrong one, the call will fail.

## Requirements

While you can use a REST API client such as `curl` or Postman to complete some of the following steps, you can only use a programming language such as 
Python to complete other steps. Both approaches are shown where applicable.

To complete the following steps, you must have the following:

* A programming language, such as Python, installed on your local development machine.
* Optionally, a REST API client such as `curl` or Postman installed on your local development machine.
* An Unstructured user account, including the Unstructure API URL and API key for the account.



* The following Python code examples assume that you have the following two environment variables set locally:

  - `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL`, set to the Workflow Endpoint API URL for your Unstructured user account.
  - `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY`, set to the API key for your Unstructured user account.

## Step 1: Get the private key

    <Accordion title="Python">
        The following Python code examples assumes that you have installed the following packages into your 
        Python virtual environment:

        - `requests`

        The following function returns the PEM version of the private key for your Unstructured user account:

        ```python
        import requests
        import os

        def get_public_key_pem() -> str:
            """
            Gets the PEM version of the public key for the calling Unstructured user.
            
            Args:
                None.

            Returns:
                str: A string representation of the user's public key.
            """
                
            headers = {
                "unstructured-api-key": os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"),
                "Accept": "application/json",
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            }

            encryption_key_response = requests.request(
                method="POST",
                url=f"{os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL")}/api/v1/users/retrieve",
                headers=headers
            )

            encryption_public_key = encryption_key_response.json().get("pem_key")
            
            return encryption_public_key
        ```

        You could call this function as follows:

        ```python
        public_key = get_public_key_pem()

        print(public_key)
        ```

        The function returns the public key in PEM format.
