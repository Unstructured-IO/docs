<Tip>
    To start using the Unstructured API's workflow operations right away, skip ahead to the [quickstart](#quickstart) or 
    [walkthrough](#walkthrough), 
    which uses the Unstructured Python SDK from remotely hosted Google Colab notebooks. These notebooks require no local setup. 
</Tip>

The [Unstructured UI](/ui/overview) features a no-code user interface for transforming your unstructured data into data that is ready 
for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

The workflow operations in the [Unstructured API](/api-reference/overview) enable a full range of partitioning, chunking, embedding, and 
enrichment options for your files and data. They are designed to batch-process files and data in remote locations; send processed results to 
various storage, databases, and vector stores; and use the latest and highest-performing models. These workflow operations have built-in logic 
to deliver the highest quality results at the lowest cost. 

This page provides an overview of the Unstructured API's workflow operations. These operations enable Unstructured UI automation usage 
scenarios as well as for documentation, reporting, and recovery needs.

## Getting started

Choose one of the following options to get started with the Unstructured API's workflow operations:

- Follow the [quickstart](#quickstart) or [walkthrough](#walkthrough), which use the Unstructured Python SDK from remotely hosted Google Colab notebooks. These notebooks require no local setup. 
- Start using the [Unstructred Python SDK](#unstructured-python-sdk). This option requires you to set up a local Python virtual environment.
- Start using a local [REST](#rest-endpoints) client, such as `curl` or Postman.

## Quickstart

The following quickstart shows how to use the [Unstructured Python SDK](/api-reference/workflow/overview#unstructured-python-sdk) 
to have Unstructured process local files by using the Unstructured API's _on-demand jobs_ functionality. This functionality 
is part of the Unstructured API's collection of [workflow operations](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/workflow/overview).

This quickstart is available in two options:

- [Use a remote notebook](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/notebooks) - This option uses a remotely hosted Google Colab notebook. There are no additional setup steps required.
- [Use your local machine](/api-reference/quickstart) - This option requires you to install the Unstructured Python SDK on your local machine.

<Note>
    The on-demand jobs functionality is designed to work *only by processing local files*.

    To process files (and data) in remote file and blob storage, databases, and vector stores, you must use other 
    workflow operations in the Unstructured API. To learn how, see for example the notebook 
    [Dropbox-To-Pinecone Connector API Quickstart for Unstructured](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Unstructured-IO/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/Dropbox_To_Pinecone_Connector_Quickstart.ipynb).  
</Note>

## Walkthrough

[This walkthrough](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/notebooks) builds upon the [quickstart](#quickstart). 
Like the quickstart, this walkthrough shows how to use the [Unstructured Python SDK](/api-reference/workflow/overview#unstructured-python-sdk) 
to have Unstructured process local files by using the Unstructured API's _on-demand jobs_ functionality. This walkthrough goes further by 
also showing in depth how to use Unstructured's [chunking](/ui/chunking), [enriching](/ui/enriching/overview), and [embedding](/ui/embedding) features. 
This walkthrough is available as a remotely hosted Google Colab notebook. This notebook requires no local setup.

Open a related [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Unstructured-IO/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/Dropbox_To_Pinecone_Connector_Quickstart.ipynb) that covers many of 
the concepts that are shown in the preceding videos.

The [Unstructured Python SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-python-client), beginning with version 0.30.6, 
allows you to call the Unstructured API's workflow operations through standard Python code.

To install the Unstructured Python SDK, run the following command from within your Python virtual environment:

```bash
pip install "unstructured-client>=0.30.6"
```

If you already have the Unstructured Python SDK installed, upgrade to at least version 0.30.6 by running the following command instead:

```bash
pip install --upgrade "unstructured-client>=0.30.6"
```

The Unstructured Python SDK code examples, shown later on this page and on related pages, use the following environment variable, which you can set as follows:

```bash
export UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY="<your-unstructured-api-key>"
```

This environment variable enables you to more easily run the following Unstructured Python SDK examples and help prevent 
you from storing scripts that contain sensitive API keys in public source code repositories.

To get your Unstructured API key, do the following:

import GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly from '/snippets/general-shared-text/get-started-simple-api-only.mdx';

<GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly/>

Calls made by the Unstructured Python SDK's `unstructured_client` functions for creating, listing, updating, 
and deleting connectors, workflows, and jobs in the Unstructured UI all use the Unstructured API's workflow operations URL. 
This URL was provided to you when your Unstructured account was created. 
If you do not have this URL, email Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).

<Note>
    The default URL for the Unstructured API's workflow operations is `https://platform.unstructuredapp.io/api/v1`. 
    However, you should always use the URL that was provided to you when your Unstructured account was created.
</Note>

To specify an API URL in your code, set the `server_url` parameter in the `UnstructuredClient` constructor to the target API URL.

The Unstructured API's workflow operations enable you to work with [connectors](#connectors),
[workflows](#workflows), and [jobs](#jobs) in the Unstructured UI.

- A _source connector_ ingests files or data into Unstructured from a source location.
- A _destination connector_ sends the processed data from Unstructured to a destination location.
- A _workflow_ defines how Unstructured will process the data.
- A _job_ runs a workflow at a specific point in time.

For general information about these objects, see:

- [Connectors](/ui/connectors)
- [Workflows](/ui/workflows)
- [Jobs](/ui/jobs)

Skip ahead to start learning about how to use the Unstructured Python SDK to work with 
[connectors](#connectors),
[workflows](#workflows), and [jobs](#jobs) programmatically.

## REST endpoints

The Unstructured API's workflow operations are callable from a set of Representational State Transfer (REST) endpoints, which you can call through standard REST-enabled 
utilities, tools, programming languages, packages, and libraries. The examples, shown later on this page and on related pages, describe how to call the Unstructured API's workflow operations with 
`curl` and Postman. You can adapt this information as needed for your preferred programming languages and libraries, for example by using the 
`requests` library with Python.

<Tip>
    You can also use the [Unstructured API's workflow operations - Swagger UI](https://platform.unstructuredapp.io/docs) to call the REST endpoints 
    that are available through the default Unstructured API's workflow operations URL: `https://platform.unstructuredapp.io`. To use the Swagger UI, you must provide your Unstructured API key with each call. To 
    get this API key, see the [quickstart](#quickstart), earlier on this page.

    Note that you should always use the URL that was provided to you when your Unstructured account was created. 
    If you do not have this URL, email Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).
</Tip>

### curl and Postman

The following `curl` examples use the following environment variables, which you can set as follows:

```bash
export UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL="https://platform.unstructuredapp.io/api/v1"
export UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY="<your-unstructured-api-key>"
```

For the API URL, this URL was provided to you when your Unstructured account was created. 
If you do not have this URL, email Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).

<Note>
    The default URL for the Unstructured API's workflow operations is `https://platform.unstructuredapp.io/api/v1`. 
    However, you should always use the URL that was provided to you when your Unstructured account was created.
</Note>

These environment variables enable you to more easily run the following `curl` examples and help prevent 
you from storing scripts that contain sensitive URLs and API keys in public source code repositories.

To get your Unstructured API key, do the following:

<GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly/>

The following Postman examples use variables, which you can set as follows:

1. In Postman, on your workspace's sidebar, click **Environments**.
2. Click **Globals**.
3. Create two global variables with the following settings:

   - **Variable**: `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL`
   - **Type**: `default`
   - **Initial value**: The Unstructured API's workflow operations URL that was provided to you when your Unstructured account was created.
   - **Current value**: The Unstructured API's workflow operations URL that was provided to you when your Unstructured account was created.
   <br/>
   - **Variable**: `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY`
   - **Type**: `secret`
   - **Initial value**: `<your-unstructured-api-key>`
   - **Current value**: `<your-unstructured-api-key>`

4. Click **Save**.

These variables enable you to more easily run the following examples in Postman and help prevent you from storing 
Postman collections that contain sensitive URLs and API keys in public source code repositories.

Unstructured offers a [Postman collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collections/collections-overview/) that you can import into Postman to make Unstructured API's workflow operations requests through a graphical user interface.

1. [Install Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/).
2. [Sign in to Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation/postman-account/#signing-in-to-postman).
3. In your workspace, click **Import**.

   ![Import a Postman collection](/img/api/post/import.png)

4. In the **Paste cURL, Raw text or URL** box, enter the following URL, and then press `Enter`:

   For all workflow operations:

   ```text
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Unstructured-IO/docs/main/examplecode/codesamples/api/Unstructured-REST-API-Workflow-Endpoint.postman_collection.json
   ```

   For [on-demand job](#run-an-on-demand-job) related operations only:

   ```text
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Unstructured-IO/docs/main/examplecode/codesamples/api/Unstructured-REST-API-On-Demand-Jobs.postman_collection.json
   ```

5. On the sidebar, click **Collections**.
6. Expand **Unstructured REST API - Workflow Endpoint**.
7. Select the request that you want to use.
8. As applicable, modify the URL as needed to specify any required resource IDs for the request.
9. On the **Headers** tab, next to `unstructured-api-key`, enter your Unstructured API key in the **Value** column. 
   As applicable, add, remove, or modify any other required headers for the request.
10. As applicable, on the **Params** tab, add, remove, or modify any required parameters for the request.
11. As applicable, on the **Body** tab, add, remove, or modify the required request body for the request.
12. Click **Send**.
13. To save the response, in the response area, click the ellipses, and then click **Save response to file**.

To get your Unstructured API key, do the following:

<GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly/>

The Unstructured API's workflow operations enable you to work with [connectors](#connectors),
[workflows](#workflows), and [jobs](#jobs) in the Unstructured UI.

- A _source connector_ ingests files or data into Unstructured from a source location.
- A _destination connector_ sends the processed data from Unstructured to a destination location.
- A _workflow_ defines how Unstructured will process the data.
- A _job_ runs a workflow at a specific point in time.

For general information about these objects, see:

- [Connectors](/ui/connectors)
- [Workflows](/ui/workflows)
- [Jobs](/ui/jobs)

Skip ahead to start learning about how to use the REST endpoints to work with 
[connectors](#connectors),
[workflows](#workflows), and [jobs](#jobs) programmatically.

## Restrictions

The following Unstructured SDKs, tools, and libraries do _not_ work with the Unstructured API's workflow operations:

- The [Unstructured JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](/api-reference/partition/legacy-api/sdk-jsts)
- [Local single-file POST requests](/api-reference/partition/legacy-api/sdk-jsts) to the Unstructured Partition Endpoint
- The [Unstructured open source Python library](/open-source/introduction/overview)
- The [Unstructured Ingest CLI](/open-source/ingestion/ingest-cli)
- The [Unstructured Ingest Python library](/open-source/ingestion/python-ingest)

The following Unstructured API URL is also _not_ supported: `https://api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general` (the default Unstructured Partition Endpoint URL).

## Connectors

You can [list](#list-source-connectors), 
[get](#get-a-source-connector), 
[create](#create-a-source-connector), 
[update](#update-a-source-connector), 
[delete](#delete-a-source-connector), and 
[test](#test-a-source-connector) source connectors. 
You can also [list](#list-destination-connectors), 
[get](#get-a-destination-connector), 
[create](#create-a-destination-connector), 
[update](#update-a-destination-connector), 
[delete](#delete-a-destination-connector), and
[test](#test-a-destination-connector) destination connectors. 

For general information, see [Connectors](/ui/connectors).

### List source connectors

To list source connectors, use the `UnstructuredClient` object's `sources.list_sources` function (for the Python SDK) or 
the `GET` method to call the `/sources` endpoint (for `curl` or Postman).

To filter the list of source connectors, use the `ListSourcesRequest` object's `source_type` parameter (for the Python SDK) 
or the query parameter `source_type=<type>` (for `curl` or Postman), 
replacing `<type>` with the source connector type's unique ID 
(for example, for the Amazon S3 source connector type, `S3` for the Python SDK or `s3` for `curl` or Postman). 
To get this ID, see [Sources](/api-reference/workflow/sources/overview).

### Create a source connector

To create a source connector, use the `UnstructuredClient` object's `sources.create_source` function (for the Python SDK) or 
the `POST` method to call the `/sources` endpoint (for `curl` or Postman). 

In the `CreateSourceConnector` object (for the Python SDK) or 
the request body (for `curl` or Postman), 
specify the settings for the connector. For the specific settings to include, which differ by connector, see 
[Sources](/api-reference/workflow/sources/overview). 

For the Python SDK, replace `<type>` with the source connector type's unique ID (for example, for the Amazon S3 source connector type, `S3`). 
To get this ID, see [Sources](/api-reference/workflow/sources/overview).

### Update a source connector

To update information about a source connector, use the `UnstructuredClient` object's `sources.update_source` function (for the Python SDK) or 
the `PUT` method to call the `/sources/<connector-id>` endpoint (for `curl` or Postman), replacing 
`<connector-id>` with the source connector's unique ID. To get this ID, see [List source connectors](#list-source-connectors).

In the `UpdateSourceConnector` object (for the Python SDK) or 
the request body (for `curl` or Postman), specify the settings for the connector. For the specific settings to include, which differ by connector, see 
[Sources](/api-reference/workflow/sources/overview).

For the Python SDK, replace `<type>` with the source connector type's unique ID (for example, for the Amazon S3 source connector type, `S3`). 
To get this ID, see [Sources](/api-reference/workflow/sources/overview).

You must specify all of the settings for the connector, even for settings that are not changing.

You can change any of the connector's settings except for its `name` and `type`.

### Update a destination connector

To update information about a destination connector, use the `UnstructuredClient` object's `destinations.update_destination` function (for the Python SDK) or 
the `PUT` method to call the `/destinations/<connector-id>` endpoint (for `curl` or Postman), replacing 
`<connector-id>` with the destination connector's unique ID. To get this ID, see [List destination connectors](#list-destination-connectors).

In the `UpdateDestinationConnector` object (for the Python SDK) or 
the request body (for `curl` or Postman), specify the settings for the connector. For the specific settings to include, which differ by connector, see 
[Destinations](/api-reference/workflow/destinations/overview).

You must specify all of the settings for the connector, even for settings that are not changing.

You can change any of the connector's settings except for its `name` and `type`.

[update](#update-a-workflow), 
and [delete](#delete-a-workflow) workflows.

For general information, see [Workflows](/ui/workflows).

### List workflows

To list workflows, use the `UnstructuredClient` object's `workflows.list_workflows` function (for the Python SDK) or 
the `GET` method to call the `/workflows` endpoint (for `curl` or Postman).

To filter the list of workflows, use one or more of the following `ListWorkflowsRequest` parameters (for the Python SDK) or 
query parameters (for `curl` or Postman):

- `source_id=<connector-id>`, replacing `<connector-id>` with the source connector's unique ID. 
  To get this ID, see [List source connectors](#list-source-connectors).
- `destination_id=<connector-id>`, replacing `<connector-id>` with the destination connector's unique ID. 
  To get this ID, see [List destination connectors](#list-destination-connectors).
- `status=WorkflowState.<status>` (for the Python SDK) or `status=<status>` (for `curl` or Postman), replacing `<status>` with one of the following workflow statuses: `ACTIVE` or `INACTIVE` (for the Python SDK) or `active` or `inactive` (for `curl` or Postman).

You can specify multiple query parameters, for example `?source_id=<connector-id>&status=<status>`.

### Create a workflow

To create a workflow, use the `UnstructuredClient` object's `workflows.create_workflow` function (for the Python SDK) or 
the `POST` method to call the `/workflows` endpoint (for `curl` or Postman).

<Note>
    The following instructions create a workflow that exists until it is explicitly deleted. 
    To create a workflow that exists only for the duration of 
    that workflow's job run, and that job run's temporary workflow takes one or more local files only as input, see [Run an on-demand job](#run-an-on-demand-job).
</Note>

In the `CreateWorkflow` object (for the Python SDK) or 
the request body (for `curl` or Postman), 
specify the settings for the workflow. For the specific settings to include, see 
[Create a workflow](/api-reference/workflow/workflows#create-a-workflow).

### Run a workflow

To run a workflow manually, use the `UnstructuredClient` object's `workflows.run_workflow` function (for the Python SDK) or 
the `POST` method to call the `/workflows/<workflow-id>/run` endpoint (for `curl` or Postman), replacing

    To run a workflow that exists only for the duration of a single job run, and the job's temporary workflow 
    takes one or more local files only as input (known as an _on-demand job_), see [Run an on-demand job](#run-an-on-demand-job).

## Jobs

You can [run on demand](#run-an-on-demand-job), [list](#list-jobs), 
[get](#get-a-job), 
and [cancel](#cancel-a-job) jobs.

A job is created automatically whenever a workflow runs on a schedule; see [Create a workflow](#create-a-workflow).
A job is also created automatically whenever you run a workflow; see [Run a workflow](#run-a-workflow).

For general information, see [Jobs](/ui/jobs).

### Run an on-demand job

To run a job whose workflow takes one or more local files only as input, and the job's temporary workflow exists only for the duration of 
that job's run (known as an _on-demand job_), use the `POST` method to call the `/jobs/` endpoint for `curl` or Postman.

<Note>
    To run a workflow that was already created at some point in the past and still exists, see [Run a workflow](#run-a-workflow).
</Note>

        In the following command, replace:

        - `</full/path/to/local/filename.extension>` with the full path to the local file to upload.
        - `<filename.extension>` with the filename of the local file to upload.
        - `<local-file-media-type>` with the local file's media type. For a list of available media types, such as `application/pdf`, see [Media Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml).
        - To upload multiple files, add additional `--form` entries, one per file.
        - For additional replacements, see the end of this section.

        ```bash
        curl --request 'POST' --location \
        "$UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL/jobs/" \

Replace the preceding placeholders as follows:

- `<job-type>` - The type of job to run. Available values include:

  - `template` - This job's workflow nodes are specified by a workflow template. 
  - `ephemeral` - This job's workflow nodes are manually specified.  

- `<workflow-template-id>` - If `<job-type>` is set to `template`, the unique ID of the workflow template to use for this job's workflow nodes. For instructions, see [List workflow templates](#list-workflow-templates) and [Get a workflow template](#get-a-workflow-template).
- `<job-node-settings>` - If `<job-type>` is set to `ephemeral`, the settings for the job's workflow nodes. For instructions, see [Custom workflow DAG nodes](/api-reference/workflow/workflows#custom-workflow-dag-nodes).

### List jobs

To list jobs, use the `UnstructuredClient` object's `jobs.list_jobs` function (for the Python SDK) or 
the `GET` method to call the `/jobs` endpoint (for `curl` or Postman).

To filter the list of jobs, use one or both of the following `ListJobsRequest` parameters (for the Python SDK) or 
query parameters (for `curl` or Postman):

- `workflow_id=<workflow-id>`, replacing `<workflow-id>` with the workflow's unique ID. 
  To get this ID, see [List workflows](#list-workflows).
- `status=<status>`, replacing `<status>` with one of the following job statuses: `completed`, `failed`, `im progress`, `scheduled`, and `stopped`.

For `curl` or Postman, you can specify multiple query parameters as `?workflow_id=<workflow-id>&status=<status>`.

### Get failed file details for a job

To get the list of any failed files for a job and why those files failed, use the `UnstructuredClient` object's `jobs.get_job_failed_files` function (for the Python SDK) or 
the `GET` method to call the `/jobs/<job-id>/failed-files` endpoint (for `curl` or Postman), replacing 
`<job-id>` with the job's unique ID. To get this ID, see [List jobs](#list-jobs).

### Download a processed local file from a job

This applies only to jobs that use a workflow with a local source and a local destination. 

To download a processed local file from a completed job, use `GET` to call the `/jobs/<job-id>/download` endpoint, replacing 
`<job-id>` with the job's unique ID. To get this ID, see [List jobs](#list-jobs).

You must also provide Unstructured's IDs for the file to download and the workflow's output node. To get these IDs, see [Get a job](#get-a-job). In the 
response: 

- Unstructured's IDs for the file to download and the workflow's output node are in the `output_node_files` array. 
- The ID for the file to download is in the `output_node_files` array's `file_id` field.
- The ID for the workflow's output node is in the `output_node_files` array's `node_id` field.

Currently, you cannot use the Unstructured user interface (UI) to download a file from a job that uses a 
workflow with a local source and a local destination.
