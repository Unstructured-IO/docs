Ingest your files into Unstructured from local storage.

This local source connector is supported only for REST API clients such as `curl` and Postman. It is currently not supported by the Unstructured user interface (UI) or the Unstructured Python SDK.

The local source connector works only with the [local destination connector](/api-reference/workflow/destinations/local). You cannot use the local source connector with any other destination connector.

For details, see the following:

1. [Create a workflow](/api-reference/workflow/workflows#create-a-workflow) that uses a local source and local destination.
2. [Run a workflow as a job](/api-reference/workflow/overview#run-a-workflow) that uses a local source and local destination.
3. [Download a processed local file from the workflow's completed job run](/api-reference/workflow/overview#download-a-processed-local-file-from-a-job).
