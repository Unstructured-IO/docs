<FirstTimeAPISourceConnector />

Ingest your files into Unstructured from Google Drive.

The requirements are as follows.

import GoogleDrivePrerequisites from '/snippets/general-shared-text/google-drive.mdx';

<GoogleDrivePrerequisites />

To create a Google Drive source connector, see the following examples.

<Warning>
    In the following examples, you must specify the `service_account_key` value as a JSON-formatted object 
    that contains the ID of the related registered secret and its encryption type. This information represents the 
    encrypted version of the contents of the Google Cloud service account's `credentials.json` key file. You get this 
    information by following the instructions in [Secrets](/api-reference/workflow/secrets).

    If you specify the `service_account_key` value as a plain-text string instead, 
    Unstructured might still create the connector successfully. However, when you then try to test or use the new connector, 
    the connector will fail and the following error message is returned: 
    `Field is sensitive and must be wrapped in as a secret reference or new secret value`.
</Warning>
