To use the [Unstructured Workflow Endpoint](/api-reference/workflow/overview) to manage jobs, do the following:

- To get a list of available jobs, use the `UnstructuredClient` object's `jobs.list_jobs` function (for the Python SDK) or 
  the `GET` method to call the `/jobs` endpoint (for `curl` or Postman). [Learn more](/api-reference/workflow/overview#list-jobs).
- To get basic information about a job, use the `UnstructuredClient` object's `jobs.get_job` function (for the Python SDK) or 
  the `GET` method to call the `/jobs/<job-id>` endpoint (for `curl` or Postman). [Learn more](/api-reference/workflow/overview#get-a-job).
- To get information about a job's current processing status, use the `UnstructuredClient` object's `jobs.get_job_details` function (for the Python SDK) or 
  the `GET` method to call the `/jobs/<job-id>/details` endpoint (for `curl` or Postman). [Learn more](/api-reference/workflow/overview#get-processing-details-for-a-job).
- To get the list of any failed files for a job and why those files failed, use the `UnstructuredClient` object's `jobs.get_failed_files` function (for the Python SDK) or 
  the `GET` method to call the `/jobs/<job-id>/failed-files` endpoint (for `curl` or Postman). [Learn more](/api-reference/workflow/overview#get-failed-file-details-for-a-job).
- A job is created automatically whenever a workflow runs on a schedule; see [Create a workflow](/api-reference/workflow/workflows#create-a-workflow).
  A job is also created whenever you run a workflow manually; see [Run a workflow](/api-reference/workflow/overview#run-a-workflow).
- To cancel a running job, use the `UnstructuredClient` object's `jobs.cancel_job` function (for the Python SDK) or 
  the `POST` method to call the `/jobs/<job-id>/cancel` endpoint (for `curl` or Postman). [Learn more](/api-reference/workflow/overview#cancel-a-job).
