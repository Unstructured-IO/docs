title: Errors
---

For the [Unstructured Python SDK](/api-reference/workflow/overview#unstructured-python-sdk), 
the [Unstructured Workflow Endpoint](/api-reference/workflow/overview) returns errors primarily through 
the `UnstructuredClientError` class (the base class for all errors raised by the Unstructured Python SDK) and 
the `HTTPValidationError` class (inherited from `UnstructuredClientError`). Less common errors are returned through the following classes:

- `httpx.RequestError`, the base class for request errors.
- `httpx.ConnectError`, for HTTP connection request errors.
- `httpx.TimeoutException`, for HTTP request timeout errors.
- `ServerError` (inherited from `UnstructuredClientError`), for server-side errors.
- `ResponseValidationError` (inherited from `UnstructuredClientError`), for type mismatches between the response data and the expected Pydantic model.

Each of the preceding classes has the following members:

| Member | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `message`      | `str`            | The eror message.                                                                           |
| `status_code`  | `int`            | The HTTP response status code, for example `401`.                                                      |
| `headers`      | `httpx.Headers`  | A collection of HTTP response headers.                                                                   |
| `body`         | `str`            | The HTTP body. This can be an empty string if no body is returned.                                  |
| `raw_response` | `httpx.Response` | The raw HTTP response.

The following example shows how to handle the preceding errors. In this example, 
a required Unstructured API key is intentionally commented out of the code, so that a 
`401 Unauthorized` error is intentionally thrown.

```python
import os

from unstructured_client import UnstructuredClient
from unstructured_client.models.operations import ListWorkflowsRequest
from unstructured_client.models.errors import (
    UnstructuredClientError,
    HTTPValidationError
)
from unstructured_client.models.errors.servererror import ServerError
from unstructured_client.models.errors.responsevalidationerror import ResponseValidationError
import httpx

try:
    client = UnstructuredClient(
        # For example, intentionally leave out the API key to intentionally throw an error.
        # api_key_auth=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY")
    )

    response = client.workflows.list_workflows(
        request=ListWorkflowsRequest()
    )
    
    print(f"Found {len(response.response_list_workflows)} workflows.")

except HTTPValidationError as e:
    print("Validation error (HTTP 422):", e)
except ServerError as e:
    print("Server error (HTTP 5XX):", e)
except ResponseValidationError as e:
    print("Response validation/type mismatch:", e)
except UnstructuredClientError as e:
    # This catches any other UnstructuredClientError not already caught above.
    # This and all of the other error classes in this example expose the following members:
    print("Other Unstructured client error:")
    print(f"Message:      {e.message}")
    print(f"Status code:  {e.status_code}")
    print(f"Body:         {e.body}")
    print(f"Raw response: {e.raw_response}")
    print(f"Headers:")

    for header in e.headers.raw:
        key = header[0].decode('utf-8')
        value = header[1].decode('utf-8')
        print(f"              {key}: {value}")

except httpx.ConnectError as e:
    print("HTTP connection error:", e)
except httpx.TimeoutException as e:
    print("HTTP timeout error:", e)
except httpx.RequestError as e:
    # This catches catch-all network errors from HTTP not already caught above.
    print("Other HTTPX request error:", e)
except Exception as e:
    # Optional: this catches any other unforeseen errors.
    print("Unexpected error:", e)
```

The results of running the preceding code are similar to the following:

```text
Message:      API error occurred: Status 401. Body: {"detail":"API key is missing, please provide an API key in the header."}
Status code:  401
Body:         {"detail":"API key is missing, please provide an API key in the header."}
Raw response: <Response [401 Unauthorized]>
Headers:
              date: <date-and-time-of-the-error>
              server: <server-identifier>
              content-length: 73
              content-type: application/json
```
