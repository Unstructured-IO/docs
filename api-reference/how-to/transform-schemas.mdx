title: Transform a JSON file into a different schema
---

## Task

You want to convert a JSON file that Unstructured produces into a separate JSON file that uses 
a different JSON schema than the one that Unstructured uses.

## Approach

Use a Python package such as [json-converter](https://pypi.org/project/json-converter/) in your Python code project 
to transform your source JSON file into a target JSON file that conforms to your own schema.

<Info>The `json-converter` package is not owned or supported by Unstructured. For questions and 
requests, see the [Issues](https://github.com/ebi-ait/json-converter/issues) tab of the 
`json-converter` repository in GitHub.</Info>

## Code

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install dependencies">
        In your local Python code project, install the [json-converter](https://pypi.org/project/json-converter/) 
        package.
        
        ```bash
        pip install json-converter
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Identify the JSON file to transform">
        1. Find the local source JSON file that you want to transform.
        2. Note the JSON field names and structures that you want to transform. For example, the JSON file might 
           look like the following (the ellipses indicate content omitted for brevity):

           ```json
           [
             {
               "type": "...",
               "element_id": "...",
               "text": "...",
               "metadata": {
                 "filetype": "...",
                 "languages": [
                   "eng"
                 ],
                 "page_number": 1,
                 "filename": "..."
               }
             },
             {
               "type": "...",
               "element_id": "...",
               "text": "...",
               "metadata": {
                 "filetype": "...",
                 "languages": [
                   "eng"
                 ],
                 "page_number": 1,
                 "filename": "..."
               }
             },
             {
               "...": "..."
             }
           ]
           ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create the JSON field mappings file">
        1. Decide what you want the JSON schema in the transformed file to look like. For example, the 
           transformed JSON file might look like the following (the ellipses indicate content omitted for brevity):

           ```json
           [
             {
               "content_type": "...",
               "content_id": "...",
               "content": "...",
               "content_properties": {
                 "page": 1
               }
             },
             {
               "content_type": "...",
               "content_id": "...",
               "content": "...",
               "content_properties": {
                 "page": 1
               }
             },
             {
               "...": "..."
             }
           ]
           ```

        2. Create the JSON field mappings file, for example:

           ```json
           {
             "content_type": ["type"],
             "content_id": ["element_id"],
             "content": ["text"]
             "content_properties.page": ["metadata.page_number"]
           }
           ```

           This file declares the following mappings:

           - The `type` field is renamed to `content_type`.
           - The `element_id` field is renamed to `content_id`.
           - The `text` field is renamed to `content`.
           - The `page_number` field nested inside `metadata` is renamed to `page` and is nested inside `content_properties`.
           - All of the other fields (`filetype`, `languages`, and `filename`) are dropped. 

           For more information about the format of this JSON field mappings file, see the 
           [Project Description](https://pypi.org/project/json-converter) in the `json-converter` page on PyPI or the 
           [README](https://github.com/ebi-ait/json-converter) in the `json-converter` repository in GitHub.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add and run the transform code">
        1. Set the following local environment variables:

           - Set `LOCAL_FILE_INPUT_PATH` to the local path to the source JSON file.
           - Set `LOCAL_FILE_OUTPUT_PATH` to the local path to the target JSON file.
           - Set `LOCAL_FIELD_MAPPINGS_PATH` to the local path to the JSON field mappings file.

        2. Add the following Python code file to your project:

           ```python
           import os, json
           from json_converter.json_mapper import JsonMapper

           # Converts one JSON file with one schema to another 
           # JSON file with a different schema. 
           # Provide the path to the input (source) and output 
           # (target) JSON files and the path to the JSON schema 
           # field mappings file.
           def convert_json_with_schemas(
               input_file_path: str,
               output_file_path: str,
               field_mappings_path: str
           ) -> None:

               output_data = []

               try:
                   with open(field_mappings_path, 'r') as f:
                       element_mappings = json.load(f)
               except FileNotFoundError:
                   print(f"Error: Input JSON schema field mappings file '{input_file_path}' not found.")
               except IOError as e:
                   print(f"I/O error occurred: {e}")
               except Exception as e:
                   print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

               try:
                   with open(input_file_path, 'r') as f:
                       input_data = json.load(f)
                       
                       for item in input_data:
                           converted_data = JsonMapper(item).map(element_mappings)
                           output_data.append(converted_data)
               except FileNotFoundError:
                   print(f"Error: Input JSON file '{input_file_path}' not found.")
               except IOError as e:
                   print(f"I/O error occurred: {e}")
               except Exception as e:
                   print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

               try:
                   with open(output_file_path, 'w') as f:
                       json.dump(output_data, f, indent=2)
               
                   print(f"Transformation complete. Output written to '{output_file_path}'.")
               except IOError as e:
                   print(f"I/O error occurred: {e}")
               except Exception as e:
                   print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

           if __name__ == "__main__":
               convert_json_with_schemas(
                   input_file_path=os.getenv("LOCAL_FILE_INPUT_PATH"),
                   output_file_path=os.getenv("LOCAL_FIELD_MAPPINGS_PATH"),
                   field_mappings_path=os.getenv("LOCAL_FILE_OUTPUT_PATH")
               )
           ```

        3. Run the Python code file.
        4. Check the path specified by `LOCAL_FILE_OUTPUT_PATH` for the transformed JSON file.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Error when trying to import Mapping from collections

**Issue**: When you run your Python code file, the following error message appears: "ImportError: cannot import name 'Mapping' from 'collections'".

**Cause**: When you use the `json-converter` package with newer versions of Python such as 3.11 and later, 
Python tries to use an outdated import in this `json-converter` package.

**Solution**: Update the `json-converter` package's source code to use a different import, as follows:

1. In your Python project, find the `json-converter` package's source location, by running the `pip show` command:

   ```bash
   pip show json-converter
   ```

   Note the path in the **Location** field.

2. Use your code editor to the open the path to the `json-converter` package's source code.
3. In the source code, open the file named `json_mapper.py`.
4. Change the following line of code...

   ```python
   from collections import Mapping
   ```

   ...to the following line of code, by adding `.abc`:

   ```python
   from collections.abc import Mapping
   ```

5. Save this source code file.
6. Run your Python code file again.
