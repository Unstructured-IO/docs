title: Choose a partitioning strategy
---

## Task

You want to use the fastest, highest-precision, yet most cost-effective [partitioning strategy](/api-reference/api-services/partitioning) overall, but you are not sure which one to specify for your particular files.

## Approach

The `--strategy` command option (CLI) or `strategy` parameter (Python/JavaScript/TypeScript) specifies the partitioning strategy to use.

Use the following decision-maker to help you determine what to set `--strategy` or `strategy` to.

<Steps>
    <Step title="How many of the files to be processed are image files, or PDF files with embedded images or tables in them?">
        - If **All**, you can increase precision for processing images and tables by specifying `hi_res` for `--strategy` or `strategy`. For additional benefits, skip ahead to **Step 2**.
        - If **Some**, you can increase precision for processing images and tables by specifying `auto` for `--strategy` or `strategy`. This will leave the decision up to Unstructured on a file-by-file basis about the best partitioning strategy to use. You have completed this decision-maker. See also [Auto partitioning strategy logic](#auto-partitioning-strategy-logic).
        - If **None**, you can increase performance and decrease cost by specifying `fast` for `--strategy` or `strategy`. You have completed this decision-maker.

        <Note>For OCR, you can also set `--strategy` or `strategy` to `ocr_only`. Unstructured will use the Tesseract OCR agent as applicable. You cannot specify any other OCR agent to be used instead.</Note> 
    </Step>
    <Step title="For object detection, do you know which particular high-resolution object detection model you want to use?">
        - If **No**, then specify `auto` for `--strategy` or `strategy`. This will decrease performance compared to answering **Yes**. You have completed this decision-maker. See also [Auto partitioning strategy logic](#auto-partitioning-strategy-logic).
        - If **Yes**, then set `--hi-res-model-name` (CLI), `hi_res_model_name` (Python), or `hiResModelName`(JavaScript/TypeScript) to the available model's name. [Learn about the available models](/api-reference/how-to/choose-hi-res-model).

## Code example

## Auto partitioning strategy logic

Setting `--strategy` or `strategy` to `auto` leaves the decision up to Unstructured on a file-by-file basis about which partitioning strategy to use. Specifically:

- If the file is an image, the `hi_res` strategy is used for that file. The `layout_v1.0.0` high-resolution object detection model is used.
- If the file is a PDF, the local processing logic or Unstructured tries to detect whether there are any embedded tables or images in that file.

  - If no embedded tables or images are detected, the `fast` strategy is used for that file. No high-resolution object detection model is used.
  - If at least one embedded table or image is found, the `hi_res` strategy is used for that file. The `layout_v1.0.0` high-resolution object detection model is used.

- If `--strategy` or `strategy` is not specified, the `auto` strategy is used by default.
