title: Extract Image Block Types
---

## Task

You want to get, decode, and show elements, such as images and tables, that are embedded in a PDF document.

## Approach

Use the Unstructured Python SDK to extract the Base64-encoded representation of specific elements, such as images and tables, in the document. 
For each of these extracted elements, decode the Base64-encoded representation of the element into its original visual representation 
and then show it.

## To run this example

You will need a document that is one of the document types supported by the `extract_image_block_types` argument. 
See the `extract_image_block_types` entry in [API Parameters](/api-reference/api-services/api-parameters). 
This example uses a PDF file with embedded images and tables.
