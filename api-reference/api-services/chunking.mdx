title: Chunking strategies
---

Chunking functions use metadata and document elements detected with partition functions to split a document into
appropriately-sized chunks for uses cases such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

If you are familiar with chunking methods that split long text documents into smaller chunks, you'll notice that
Unstructured methods slightly differ, since the partitioning step already divides an entire document into its structural elements.

Individual elements will only be split if they exceed the desired maximum chunk size. Two or more consecutive text elements
that will together fit within `max_characters` will be combined. After chunking, you will only have elements of the
following types:

* `CompositeElement`: Any text element will become a `CompositeElement` after chunking. A composite element can be a
combination of two or more original text elements that together fit within the maximum chunk size. It can also be a single
element that doesn't leave room in the chunk for any others but fits by itself. Or it can be a fragment of an original
text element that was too big to fit in one chunk and required splitting.
* `Table`:  A table element is not combined with other elements and if it fits within `max_characters` it will remain as is.
* `TableChunk`: large tables that exceed `max_characters` chunk size are split into special `TableChunk` elements.

### "by_page" chunking strategy

Only available in Unstructured API and Platform.

The `by_page` chunking strategy ensures the content from different pages do not end up in the same chunk.
When a new page is detected, the existing chunk is completed and a new one is started, even if the next element would fit in the
prior chunk.

### "by_similarity" chunking strategy

Only available in Unstructured API and Platform.

The `by_similarity` chunking strategy employs the `sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1` embedding model to
identify topically similar sequential elements and combine them into chunks.

As with other strategies, chunks will never exceed the hard-maximum chunk size set by `max_characters`. For this reason,
not all elements that share a topic will necessarily appear in the same chunk. However, with this strategy you can
guarantee that two elements with low similarity will not be combined in a single chunk.

You can control the level of topic similarity you require for elements to have by setting the `similarity_threshold` parameter.
`similarity_threshold` expects a value between 0.0 and 1.0 specifying the minimum similarity text in consecutive elements
must have to be included in the same chunk. The default is 0.5.
