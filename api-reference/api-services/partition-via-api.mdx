title: Process an individual file by using the Unstructured open source Python library
sidebarTitle: Open source Python library
---

If you're used to working the [Unstructured open source library](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured) but
would like to leverage the advanced capabilities of Unstructured API services, you can do so without leaving your familiarity with the open source library. 
Whether you're using the Free Unstructured API, the Unstructured Serverless API,
the Unstructured API on Azure/AWS, or your local deployment of the Unstructured API, you can use the open source library to send an individual file through `partition_via_api` for processing with Unstructured API services.

<Note>To process files in batches instead, and to use non-local source and destination locations, see the options for [Batch processing and ingestion](/api-reference/ingest/overview).</Note>

To use the open source library, you'll also need:

import SharedAPIKeyURL from '/snippets/general-shared-text/api-key-url.mdx';

<SharedAPIKeyURL />

import NoURLForServerlessAPI from '/snippets/general-shared-text/no-url-for-serverless-api.mdx';

<NoURLForServerlessAPI/>

## Installation

Make sure you have the Unstructured open source library installed.
Refer to the [Unstructured open source library quickstart guide](/open-source/introduction/quick-start) for instructions.

## Basics

Here's a basic example in which you send an email file to partition via Unstructured API using `partition_via_api` available
in the Unstructured open source library:

```python
import os, json

from unstructured.partition.api import partition_via_api

elements = partition_via_api(
    filename="example-docs/eml/fake-email.eml",
    api_key=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"),
    api_url=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL"),
    content_type="message/rfc822"
)

element_dicts = [element.to_dict() for element in elements]
json_elements = json.dumps(element_dicts, indent=2)

# Print the processed data.
print(json_elements)

# Write the processed data to a local file.
with open("example-docs/eml/fake-email-output.json", "w") as file:
    file.write(json_elements)
```

When sending a request to the Free Unstructured API, you only need to provide your individual API key.
When sending requests to the Unstructured Serverless API, you need to supply your unique API URL in addition to your API key.
For Unstructured API on Azure/AWS, use the API URL that you configured through those services.

## Parameters & examples

The API parameters are the same across all methods of accessing the Unstructured API.

* Refer to the [API parameters](/api-reference/api-services/api-parameters) page for the full list of available parameters.
* Refer to the [Examples](/api-reference/api-services/examples) page for some inspiration on using the parameters.
