title: Python and TypeScript SDKs
description: This documentation covers the usage of the Python and TypeScript SDKs for interacting with the Unstructured API.
---

The [Python](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-python-client) and
[TypeScript](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-js-client)
SDK clients allow for easy interaction with the Unstructured API. Whether you're using the
free Unstructured API, the SaaS Unstructured API, Unstructured API on Azure/AWS or your local
deployment of Unstructured API, you can access the API using the Python or TypeScript SDK.

## Installation

    Before using the SDK to interact with your Unstructured API, install the library:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Python
    pip install unstructured-client
    ```
    ```bash JavaScript
    npm install unstructured-client
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Note>
        The SDKs use semantic versioning and major bumps could bring breaking changes. It is advised to
        pin your installed version.
    </Note>

## Basics
    Let's start with a simple example in which you send a pdf document to be partitioned via the free Unstructured API:

    <Warning>
         The TypeScript SDK has the following breaking changes in v0.11.0:
         * Imports under the `dist` path have moved up a level
         * Enums are now used for parameters with a set of options
           * This includes `chunkingStrategy`, `outputFormat`, and `strategy`
         * All parameters to `partition` have moved to a `partitionParameters` object
    </Warning>

    <Warning>
        Python SDK Deprecation Warning (>v0.22.0): The legacy method of passing `shared.PartitionParameters`
        directly to `client.general.partition()` is currently supported but may be deprecated and
        could break in future releases. Users should migrate to the new `shared.PartitionRequest` object 
        to ensure compatibility with future updates.
    </Warning>

    <Note>
    By default, the SDKs send requests to the free API. In order to access the paid API, you'll need
    to include the argument for the server URL. If you receive authentication errors, and you've
    checked that your key is correct, be sure that you are accessing the correct endpoint.
    </Note>

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import unstructured_client
    from unstructured_client.models import operations, shared

    client = unstructured_client.UnstructuredClient(
        api_key_auth="YOUR_API_KEY",
        # server_url="YOUR_API_URL",
    )

    filename = "PATH_TO_FILE"
    file = open(filename, "rb")
    req = operations.PartitionRequest(
        partition_parameters=shared.PartitionParameters(
            files=shared.Files(
                content=file.read(),
                file_name=filename,
            ),
            # --- Other partition parameters ---
            # Note: Defining `strategy`, `chunking_strategy`, and `output_format`
            # parameters as strings is accepted, but will not pass strict type checking. It is
            # advised to use the defined enum classes as shown below.
            strategy=shared.Strategy.AUTO,  
            languages=['eng'],
        ),
    )

    res = client.general.partition(request=req)

    if res.elements is not None:
        # Handle the response
        pass
    ```
    ```javascript TypeScript
    import { UnstructuredClient } from "unstructured-client";
    import { PartitionResponse } from "unstructured-client/sdk/models/operations";
    import { Strategy } from "unstructured-client/sdk/models/shared";
    import * as fs from "fs";

    const key = "YOUR_API_KEY";

    const client = new UnstructuredClient({
        // serverURL: "YOUR_API_URL",
        security: {
            apiKeyAuth: key,
        },
    });

    const filename = "PATH_TO_FILE";
    const data = fs.readFileSync(filename);

    client.general.partition({
        partitionParameters: {
            files: {
                content: data,
                fileName: filename,
            },
            strategy: Strategy.Fast,
        }
    }).then((res: PartitionResponse) => {
        if (res.statusCode == 200) {
            console.log(res.elements);
        }
    }).catch((e) => {
        if (e.statusCode) {
          console.log(e.statusCode);
          console.log(e.body);
        } else {
          console.log(e);
        }
    });
    ```
    ```python Python (SDK <=v0.22.0)
    import unstructured_client
    from unstructured_client.models import shared
    from unstructured_client.models.errors import SDKError

    client = unstructured_client.UnstructuredClient(
        api_key_auth="YOUR_API_KEY",
        # server_url="YOUR_API_URL",
    )

    filename = "PATH_TO_FILE"
    file = open(filename, "rb")

    req = shared.PartitionParameters(
        files=shared.Files(
            content=file.read(),
            file_name=filename,
        ),
        # Other partition parameters
        strategy="auto",
        languages=['eng'], 
    )

    try:
        res = client.general.partition(request=req)
        print(res.elements[0])
    except SDKError as e:
        print(e)
    ```
    ```javascript TypeScript (SDK <=v0.10.6)
    import { UnstructuredClient } from "unstructured-client";
    import { PartitionResponse } from "unstructured-client/dist/sdk/models/operations";
    import * as fs from "fs";

    const key = "YOUR_API_KEY";

    const client = new UnstructuredClient({
        // serverURL: "YOUR_API_URL",
        security: {
            apiKeyAuth: key,
        },
    });

    const filename = "PATH_TO_FILE";
    const data = fs.readFileSync(filename);

    client.general.partition({
        files: {
            content: data,
            fileName: filename,
        },
        strategy: 'fast'
    }).then((res: PartitionResponse) => {
        if (res.statusCode == 200) {
            console.log(res.elements);
        }
    }).catch((e) => {
      if (e.statusCode) {
        console.log(e.statusCode);
        console.log(e.body);
      } else {
        console.log(e);
      }
    });
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Note that currently, the SDKs only support sending one file at a time.

## SaaS Unstructured API

    If you want to use the SaaS Unstructured API, all you need to do is initialize the SDK client with
    the unique API URL that you received in the same email as your API key. For Unstructured API on
    Azure/AWS, use the API URL that you configured through those services.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    client = unstructured_client.UnstructuredClient(
        api_key_auth="YOUR_API_KEY",
        server_url="YOUR_API_URL",
    )
    ```
    ```javascript TypeScript
    const client = new UnstructuredClient({
        security: { apiKeyAuth: "YOUR_API_KEY" },
        serverURL: "YOUR_API_URL",
    });
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

## Page Splitting

    In order to speed up processing of long PDF files, set the `splitPdfPage`[*](#parameter-names) parameter to `true`. This will
    cause the PDF to be split into small batches of pages by the client before sending requests to the API. The client
    awaits all parallel requests and combines the responses into a single response object. This will
    work only for PDF files, so don't set it for other types of files.

    The number of parallel requests is controlled by `splitPdfConcurrencyLevel`[*](#parameter-names). 
    The default is 5 and the max is set to 15 to avoid high resource usage and costs.

    If at least one request is successful, the responses are combined into a single response object. An
    error is returned only if all requests failed or there was an error during splitting.

    When using page splitting, note that chunking will not always work as expected since chunking will happen on the
    API side. When chunking elements the whole document context is processed but when we use splitting we only have a part
    of the context. If you need to chunk, you can make a second request to the API with the returned elements.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    req = operations.PartitionRequest(
        partition_parameters=shared.PartitionParameters(
            files=shared.Files(
                content=file.read(),
                file_name=filename,
            ),
            split_pdf_page=True,  # Set `split_pdf_page` parameter to `True` to enable splitting the PDF file
            split_pdf_concurrency_level=10,  # Modify split_pdf_concurrency_level to set the number of parallel requests
        )
    )
    res = client.general.partition(req)
    ```
    ```javascript TypeScript
    client.general.partition({
        partitionParameters: {
            files: {
                content: data,
                fileName: filename,
            },
            // Set `splitPdfPage` parameter to `true` to enable splitting the PDF file
            splitPdfPage: true,
            // Modify splitPdfConcurrencyLevel to set the number of parallel requests
            splitPdfConcurrencyLevel: 10,
        }
    })
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

## Customizing the Client
    ### Retries
        You can also change the defaults for retries through the `retryConfig`[*](#parameter-names)
        when initializing the client. If a request to the API fails, the client will retry the 
        request with an exponential backoff strategy up to a maximum interval of one minute. The
        function keeps retrying until the total elapsed time exceeds `maxElapsedTime`[*](#parameter-names),
        which defaults to one hour:

        <CodeGroup>
        ```python Python
        client = UnstructuredClient(
            api_key_auth="YOUR_API_KEY",
            retry_config=RetryConfig(
                strategy="backoff",
                retry_connection_errors=True,
                backoff=BackoffStrategy(
                    # time intervals are defined in milliseconds
                    initial_interval=500,
                    max_interval=60000,
                    exponent=1.5,
                    max_elapsed_time=900000,  # 15min*60sec*1000ms = 15 minutes
                ),
            )
        )
        ```
        ```javascript TypeScript
        const client = new UnstructuredClient({
            security: { apiKeyAuth: "YOUR_API_KEY" },
            serverURL: "YOUR_API_URL",
            retryConfig: {
                strategy: "backoff",
                retryConnectionErrors: true,
                backoff: {
                    initialInterval: 500,
                    maxInterval: 60000,
                    exponent: 1.5,
                    maxElapsedTime: 900000, // 15min*60sec*1000ms = 15 minutes
                },
            };
        });
        ```
        </CodeGroup>

    ### Disabling SSL Validation

        If you disable SSL validation, requests will accept any TLS certificate
        presented by the server and ignore hostname mismatches and/or expired certificates, 
        which will make your application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
        Only set this to `False` for testing.

        <CodeGroup>
        ```python Python
        http_client = requests.Session()
        http_client.verify = False

        client = UnstructuredClient(
            client=http_client,
            ...
        )
        ```
        </CodeGroup>

## Handling the Response

    The partition response defaults to a dict format that can be converted to Unstructured elements with
    the `elements_from_dicts` utility function as seen below. Otherwise, the API response can be sent directly 
    to your vector store or another destination.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    from unstructured.staging.base import elements_from_dicts

    ...

    if res.elements is not None:
        elements = elements_from_dicts(response.elements)
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

## Parameters & examples

    #### Parameter names 
        The parameter names used in this document are for the TypeScript SDK, which follow camelCase
        convention (while the Python SDK uses snake_case). Other than this difference in naming convention, 
        the names used in the SDKs are the same across all methods.

    * Refer to the [API parameters](/api-reference/api-services/api-parameters) page for the full list of available parameters.
    * Refer to the [Examples](/api-reference/api-services/examples) page for some inspiration on using the parameters.
