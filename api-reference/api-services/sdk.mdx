title: Python and JavaScript SDKs
description: This documentation covers the usage of the Python and JavaScript SDKs for interacting with the Unstructured API.
---

The [Python](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-python-client) and
[JavaScript](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-js-client)
SDK clients allow for easy interaction with the Unstructured API. Whether you're using the
free Unstructured API, the SaaS Unstructured API, Unstructured API on Azure/AWS or your local
deployment of Unstructured API, you can access the API using the Python or JavaScript SDK.

## Installation

    Before using the SDK to interact with your Unstructured API, install the library:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Python
    pip install unstructured-client
    ```
    ```bash JavaScript
    npm install unstructured-client
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Note>
        The SDKs use semantic versioning and major bumps could bring breaking changes. It is advised to
        pin your installed version.
    </Note>

## Basics

    <Note>
        Python SDK Deprecation Warning (>v0.22.0): The legacy method of passing `shared.PartitionParameters`
        directly to `client.general.partition()` is currently supported but may be deprecated and
        could break in future releases. Users should migrate to the new `shared.PartitionRequest` object 
        to ensure compatibility with future updates.
    </Note>

    Let's start with a simple example in which you send a pdf document to be partitioned via the free Unstructured API:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import unstructured_client
    from unstructured_client.models import operations, shared

    client = unstructured_client.UnstructuredClient(
        api_key_auth="YOUR_API_KEY",
        # You only need to provide your unique API URL if using the paid api
        # server_url="YOUR_API_URL",
    )

    filename = "sample-docs/layout-parser-paper.pdf"
    file = open(filename, "rb")
    req = operations.PartitionRequest(
        partition_parameters=shared.PartitionParameters(
            # --- `files` is the only required parameter ---
            files=shared.Files(  # The sdk currently only supports sending a single file
                content=file.read(),
                file_name=filename,
            ),
            # --- Other partition parameters ---
            # Note: Defining `strategy`, `chunking_strategy`, and `output_format`
            # parameters as strings is accepted, but will not pass strict type checking. It is
            # advised to use the new enum classes for defining those parameters as shown below.
            strategy=shared.Strategy.AUTO,  
            chunking_strategy=shared.ChunkingStrategy.BY_PAGE,
            languages=['eng'], 
            starting_page_number=1,
        ),
    )

    res = client.general.partition(request=req)

    if res.elements is not None:
        # Handle the response
        pass
    ```
    ```javascript JavaScript
    import { openAsBlob } from "node:fs";
    import { UnstructuredClient } from "unstructured-client";
    import { Strategy, ChunkingStrategy } from "unstructured-client/sdk/models/shared";

    const client = new UnstructuredClient({
        security: { apiKeyAuth: "YOUR_API_KEY" },
        // You only need to provide your unique API URL if using the paid api
        // serverURL: "YOUR_API_URL",
    });

    async function run() {
        const res = await client.general.partition({
            partitionParameters: {
                // --- `files` is the only required parameter ---
                files: await openAsBlob("./sample-file"),  // The sdk currently only supports sending a single file
                // --- Other partition params ---
                strategy: Strategy.Auto,
                chunkingStrategy: ChunkingStrategy.ByPage,
                languages: ['eng'], 
                startingPageNumber: 1,
            },
        });

        // Handle the response
        console.log(res)
    }

    run();
    ```
    ```python Python (SDK <v0.22.0)
    import unstructured_client
    from unstructured_client.models import shared
    from unstructured_client.models.errors import SDKError

    client = unstructured_client.UnstructuredClient(
        api_key_auth="YOUR_API_KEY",
        # You only need to provide your unique API URL if using the paid api
        # server_url="YOUR_API_URL",
    )

    filename = "sample-docs/layout-parser-paper.pdf"
    file = open(filename, "rb")

    # Requests not wrapped in `shared.PartitionRequest` may be deprecated and break in future versions
    req = shared.PartitionParameters(
        files=shared.Files(  # The sdk currently only supports sending a single file
            content=file.read(),
            file_name=filename,
        ),
        # Other partition parameters
        languages=['eng'],
        strategy="fast",
    )

    try:
        res = client.general.partition(request=req)
        print(res.elements[0])
    except SDKError as e:
        print(e)
    ```
    ```javascript JavaScript (SDK <v0.10.6)
    import { UnstructuredClient } from "unstructured-client";
    import { PartitionResponse } from "unstructured-client/dist/sdk/models/operations";
    import * as fs from "fs";

    const key = "YOUR_API_KEY";

    const client = new UnstructuredClient({
        security: { apiKeyAuth: "YOUR_FREE_API_KEY" },
        // You only need to provide your unique API URL if using the SaaS Unstructured API
        // serverURL: "YOUR_API_URL",
    });

    const filename = "sample-docs/layout-parser-paper.pdf";
    const data = fs.readFileSync(filename);

    client.general.partition({
        // The sdk currently only supports sending a single file
        files: {
            content: data,
            fileName: filename,
        },
        // Other partition params
        strategy: "auto",
    })
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    In the example above we're sending the request to the free Unstructured API, where the API URL is
    the same for all users, so you don't need to provide the server URL. However, you still need to
    authenticate using your individual API Key.

## Paid API

    If you want to use the SaaS Unstructured API, all you need to do is initialize the SDK client with
    the unique API URL that you received in the same email as your API key. For Unstructured API on
    Azure/AWS, use the API URL that you configured through those services.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    client = unstructured_client.UnstructuredClient(
        api_key_auth="YOUR_API_KEY",
        server_url="YOUR_API_URL",
    )
    ```
    ```javascript JavaScript
    const client = new UnstructuredClient({
        security: { apiKeyAuth: "YOUR_API_KEY" },
        serverURL: "YOUR_API_URL",
    });
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

## Page Splitting

    In order to speed up processing of long PDF files, set the `splitPdfPage`[*](#parameter-names) parameter to `true`. This will
    cause the PDF to be split into small batches of pages by the client before sending requests to the API. The client
    awaits all parallel requests and combines the responses into a single response object. This will
    work only for PDF files, so don't set it for other types of files.

    The number of parallel requests is controlled by `splitPdfConcurrencyLevel`[*](#parameter-names). 
    The default is 5 and the max is set to 15 to avoid high resource usage and costs.

    If at least one request is successful, the responses are combined into a single response object. An
    error is returned only if all requests failed or there was an error during splitting.

    When using page splitting, note that chunking will not always work as expected since chunking will happen on the
    API side. When chunking elements the whole document context is processed but when we use splitting we only have a part
    of the context. If you need to chunk, you can make a second request to the API with the returned elements.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    res = client.general.partition(request=operations.PartitionRequest(
        partition_parameters=shared.PartitionParameters(
            files=shared.Files(
                content=file.read(),
                file_name=filename,
            ),
            split_pdf_page=True,  # Set `split_pdf_page` parameter to `True` to enable splitting the PDF file
            split_pdf_concurrency_level=10,  # Modify split_pdf_concurrency_level to set the number of parallel requests
        ),
    ))
    ```
    ```javascript JavaScript
    client.general.partition({
        files: {
            content: data,
            fileName: filename,
        },
        // Set `splitPdfPage` parameter to `true` to enable splitting the PDF file
        splitPdfPage: true,
        // Modify splitPdfConcurrencyLevel to set the number of parallel requests
        splitPdfConcurrencyLevel: 10,
    })
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

## Customizing the Client
    ### Retries
        You can also change the defaults for retries through the `retryConfig`[*](#parameter-names)
        when initializing the client. If a request to the API fails, the client will retry the 
        request with an exponential backoff strategy up to a maximum interval of one minute. The
        function keeps retrying until the total elapsed time exceeds `maxElapsedTime`[*](#parameter-names),
        which defaults to one hour:

        <CodeGroup>
        ```python Python
        client = UnstructuredClient(
            api_key_auth="YOUR_API_KEY",
            retry_config=RetryConfig("backoff", BackoffStrategy(
                # time intervals are defined in milliseconds
                initial_interval=500,
                max_interval=60000,
                exponent=1.5,
                max_elapsed_time=900000,  # 15min*60sec*1000ms = 15 minutes
            ), False),
            retry_connection_errors=True,  // Set to `False` to disable retries completely
        )
        ```
        ```javascript JavaScript
        const client = new UnstructuredClient({
            security: { apiKeyAuth: "YOUR_API_KEY" },
            serverURL: "YOUR_API_URL",
            retryConfig: {
                strategy: "backoff",
                backoff: {
                    initialInterval: 500,
                    maxInterval: 60000,
                    exponent: 1.5,
                    maxElapsedTime: 900000, // 15min*60sec*1000ms = 15 minutes
                },
                retryConnectionErrors: true,  // Set to `false` to disable retries completely
            };
        });
        ```
        </CodeGroup>

    ### Disabling SSL Validation

        If you disabling SSL validation, requests will accept any TLS certificate
        presented by the server and ignore hostname mismatches and/or expired certificates, 
        which will make your application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
        Only set this to `False` for testing.

        <CodeGroup>
        ```python Python
        http_client = requests.Session()
        http_client.verify = False

        client = UnstructuredClient(
            client=http_client,
            ...
        )
        ```
        </CodeGroup>

## Handling the Response

    The partition response defaults to a dict format that can be converted to Unstructured elements with
    the `elements_from_dicts` utility function as seen below. Otherwise, the api response can be sent directly 
    to your vector store or another destination.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    from unstructured.staging.base import elements_from_dicts

    ...

    if res.elements is not None:
        elements = elements_from_dicts(response.elements)
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

## Parameters & examples

    #### Parameter names 
        The parameter names used in this document are for the JavaScript SDK, which follow camelCase
        convention (while the Python SDK uses snake_case). Other than this difference in naming convention, 
        the names used in the SDKs are the same across all methods.

    * Refer to the [API parameters](/api-reference/api-services/api-parameters) page for the full list of available parameters.
    * Refer to the [Examples](/api-reference/api-services/examples) page for some inspiration on using the parameters.
