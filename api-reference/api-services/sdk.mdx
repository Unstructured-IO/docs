title: Python and JavaScript SDKs
description: This documentation covers the usage of the Python and JavaScript SDKs for interacting with the Unstructured API.
---

The [Python](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-python-client) and
[JavaScript](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-js-client)
SDKs allow for easy interaction with the Unstructured API using Python. Whether you're using the
free Unstructured API, the SaaS Unstructured API, Unstructured API on Azure/AWS or your local
deployment of Unstructured API, you can access the API using the Python or JavaScript SDK.

## Installation

Before using the SDK to interact with your Unstructured API, install the library:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Python
pip install unstructured-client
```

```bash JavaScript
npm install unstructured-client
```

</CodeGroup>

## Basics

<Note>
    Python SDK Deprecation Warning (>v0.22.0): The legacy method of passing `shared.PartitionParameters`
    directly to `client.general.partition()` is currently supported but may be deprecated and
    could break in future releases. Users should migrate to the new `shared.PartitionRequest` object 
    to ensure compatibility with future updates.
</Note>
<Note>
    Python SDK Deprecation Warning (>v0.22.0): Defining `strategy`, `chunking_strategy`, and `output_format`
    parameters as strings may also be deprecated and could break in future releases. It is
    advised to use the new enum classes for defining those parameters. Ex: `shared.Strategy.HI_RES`
</Note>

Let's start with a simple example in which you send a pdf document to partition via Unstructured API:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import unstructured_client
from unstructured_client.models import operations, shared

client = unstructured_client.UnstructuredClient(
    api_key_auth="YOUR_API_KEY",
    # You may need to provide your unique API URL
    # server_url="YOUR_API_URL",
)

filename = "sample-docs/layout-parser-paper.pdf"
file = open(filename, "rb")

res = client.general.partition(request=operations.PartitionRequest(
    partition_parameters=shared.PartitionParameters(
        files=shared.Files(  # The sdk currently only supports sending a single file
            content=file.read(),
            file_name=filename,
        ),
        # Other partition parameters
        strategy=shared.Strategy.HI_RES,
        chunking_strategy=shared.ChunkingStrategy.BY_PAGE,
        languages=['eng'], 
        starting_page_number=1,
    ),
))

if res.elements is not None:
    # handle response
    pass
```

```python Python (SDK <v0.22.0)
import unstructured_client
from unstructured_client.models import shared
from unstructured_client.models.errors import SDKError

client = unstructured_client.UnstructuredClient(
    api_key_auth="YOUR_API_KEY",
    # You may need to provide your unique API URL
    # server_url="YOUR_API_URL",
)

filename = "sample-docs/layout-parser-paper.pdf"
file = open(filename, "rb")

# Creating the request without `shared.PartitionRequest` may be deprecated
req = shared.PartitionParameters(
    files=shared.Files(  # The sdk currently only supports sending a single file
        content=file.read(),
        file_name=filename,
    ),
    # Other partition parameters
    # Definind `strategy` as a string may be deprecated in favor of enum classes: `shared.ChunkingStrategy.FAST`
    strategy="fast",
    languages=['eng'],
)

try:
    res = client.general.partition(req)
    print(res.elements[0])
except SDKError as e:
    print(e)
```

```javascript JavaScript (SDK <v0.10.6)
import { UnstructuredClient } from "unstructured-client";
import { PartitionResponse } from "unstructured-client/dist/sdk/models/operations";
import * as fs from "fs";

const key = "YOUR_API_KEY";

const client = new UnstructuredClient({
    // You may need to provide your unique API URL
    // serverURL: "YOUR_API_URL",
    security: {
        apiKeyAuth: key,
    },
});

const filename = "sample-docs/layout-parser-paper.pdf";
const data = fs.readFileSync(filename);

client.general.partition({
    // The sdk currently only supports sending a single file
    files: {
        content: data,
        fileName: filename,
    },
    // Other partition params
    strategy: "fast",
}).then((res: PartitionResponse) => {
    if (res.statusCode == 200) {
        console.log(res.elements);
    }
}).catch((e) => {
    console.log(e.statusCode);
    console.log(e.body);
});
```

</CodeGroup>

In the example above we're sending the request to the free Unstructured API, in which case the API URL is the same for all
users and you don't need to provide it. Note, however, that you still need to authenticate yourself with
your individual API Key.

If you want to use the SaaS Unstructured API, you need to define `server_url` as the unique API URL that you
received in the same email as your API key. For Unstructured API on Azure/AWS, use the API URL that you
configured through those services.

## Parameters & examples

The API parameters are the same across all methods of accessing the Unstructured API.

* Refer to the [API parameters](/api-reference/api-services/api-parameters) page for the full list of available parameters.
* Refer to the [Examples](/api-reference/api-services/examples) page for some inspiration on using the parameters.
