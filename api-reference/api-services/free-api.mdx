title: Free Unstructured API
description: This page describes how to obtain an API key to use with the free Unstructured API, the limitations of the free Unstructured API, and provides a quickstart example.
---

## Get an API key

The Free Unstructured API requires authentication via an API key. Here's how you can obtain your API key:

1.  Go to [https://unstructured.io/api-key-free](https://unstructured.io/api-key-free).
2.  Fill out the registration form. Make sure your contact information (especially your **Email**) is valid.
3.  Check the **I agree** box if you consent to Unstructured contacting you about our products and services.
4.  Click the **Terms and Conditions** link, read it, and check the related box to agree.
5.  Click **Submit**. You will receive a Free Unstructured API key at the **Email** you provided. Store your API key in a secure location. Do not share it with others.
6.  For the Free Unstructured API, you must also provide an API URL only when you make [POST requests](#post-request), and the API URL for POST requests is always `https://api.unstructured.io/general/v0/general`. In all other cases, the API URL is an empty string.

import FreeKeyNoServerlessURL from '/snippets/general-shared-text/free-api-key-no-serverless-access.mdx';

## Free Unstructured API limitations

The Free Unstructured API is designed for prototyping purposes, and not for production use:
* The API usage is limited to 1000 pages per month.
* Unlike the users of Unstructured Serverless API, users of the Free Unstructured API to do not get their own dedicated infrastructure.
* The data sent over the Free Unstructured API can be used for model training purposes, and other service improvements.

If you require a production-ready API, consider using the [Unstructured Serverless API](/api-reference/api-services/saas-api-development-guide) instead.

## Quickstart

Let's say you want to preprocess an `*.eml` file using the free Unstructured API. There are several ways
you can do this, which all lead to the same result, so pick your preferred method: [POST](#post-request), [CLI](#unstructured-ingest-cli), [SDK](#unstructured-python-sdk-and-javascript-typescript-sdk), or [open source](#calling-the-unstructured-api-from-the-unstructured-open-source-library).

<Info>When using the Free Unstructured API, use `https://api.unstructured.io/general/v0/general` as the URL for `POST` requests, or a blank string as the URL when using the CLI, SDKs, or open source library. Note that the Free API URL has a slightly different domain name than the Serverless API which is `api.unstructuredapp.io`.</Info>

### POST request

To work with the Unstructured Serverless API by calling the Unstructured REST API POST with `curl`, first do the following:

- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your Free Unstructured API key.
- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` environment variable to your Free Unstructured API URL, which for POST requests is always `https://api.unstructured.io/general/v0/general`.

<Info>Setting the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` environment variable makes your code forward-compatible if you later upgrade to the [Unstructured Serverless API](/api-reference/api-services/saas-api-development-guide), which requires a different API URL.</Info>

Now, use `curl` to call the API, replacing:

- `<local/path/to/input/file>` with the path to the source (input) file on your local machine.
- `<local/path/to/output/file>` with the path to the destination (output) on your local machine where Unstructured will deliver the processed data. 

```bash
curl -X POST $UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL \
     -H 'accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
     -H 'unstructured-api-key: $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY' \
     -F 'files=@<local/path/to/input/file>' \
     -o '<local/path/to/output/file>'
```

After the command successfully runs, see the results in the specified output path on your local machine.

If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

<Info>`POST` requests support using only local machine paths as the source (input) for the file to preprocess and as the destination (output) that Unstructured sends the processed data to. To specify a source or destination other than a local machine, use the [Unstructured Ingest CLI](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-cli) or the [Unstructured Ingest Python library](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-python-library) instead.</Info>

import SharedPOSTSingleFile from '/snippets/general-shared-text/post-api-single-file.mdx';

### Unstructured Ingest CLI

To work with the Free Unstructured API by using the Unstructured Ingest CLI, you will need to:

- Install Python, and then install the CLI package:

  ```bash
  pip install unstructured
  ```

- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your Free Unstructured API key.

Now, use the CLI to call the API, replacing:

- `<local/path/to/input/files>` with the path to the source (input) files on your local machine.
- `<local/path/to/output/files>` with the path to the destination (output) on your local machine where Unstructured will deliver the processed data. 

```bash CLI
unstructured-ingest \
  local \
    --input-path <local/path/to/input/files> \
    --output-dir <local/path/to/output/files> \
    --partition-by-api \
    --api-key $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY
```

After the command successfully runs, see the results in the specified output path on your local machine.

If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

To learn more about how to use the `local` command, run the command `unstructured-ingest local --help`.

To use source and destination locations outside of your local machine, see the documentation for the available [source](/api-reference/ingest/source-connectors/overview) and [destination](/api-reference/ingest/destination-connector/overview) connectors.

### Unstructured Python SDK and JavaScript/TypeScript SDK

To work with the Free Unstructured API in Python or JavaScript, use the
Unstructured [Python SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-python-client), or
[JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-js-client).

<Info>The JavaScript/TypeScript SDK supports using only local machine paths as the source (input) for the files to preprocess and as the destination (output) that Unstructured sends the processed data to. To specify a source or destination other than a local machine, use the [Unstructured Ingest CLI](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-cli) or the [Unstructured Ingest Python library](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-python-library) instead.</Info>

First, install your preferred SDK:
<CodeGroup>

```bash
pip install unstructured-client
```

```bash  JavaScript/TypeScript
npm install unstructured-client
```
</CodeGroup>

Next, set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your Free Unstructured API key.

Now, call the API, replacing:

- `<local/path/to/input/file>` with the path to the source (input) file on your local machine.
- `<local/path/to/output/file>` with the path to the destination (output) on your local machine where Unstructured will deliver the processed data.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import json, os

from unstructured_client import UnstructuredClient
from unstructured_client.models import operations, shared

input_filepath = "<local/path/to/input/file>"
output_filepath = "<local/path/to/output/file>"

client = UnstructuredClient(
    api_key_auth=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY")
)

with open(input_filepath, "rb") as f:
    files = shared.Files(
        content=f.read(),
        file_name=input_filepath
    )

req = operations.PartitionRequest(
    shared.PartitionParameters(
        files=files,
        strategy=shared.Strategy.AUTO
    )
)

try:
    res = client.general.partition(request=req)
    element_dicts = [element for element in res.elements]
    json_elements = json.dumps(element_dicts, indent=2)
    
    # Print the processed data.
    print(json_elements)

    # Write the processed data to a local file.
    with open(output_filepath, "w") as file:
      file.write(json_elements)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { UnstructuredClient } from "unstructured-client";
import { Strategy } from "unstructured-client/sdk/models/shared/index.js";
import * as fs from "fs";

const inputFilepath = "<local/path/to/input/file>" || '';
const outputFilepath = "<local/path/to/output/file>" || ''

const key = process.env.UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY || '';

const client = new UnstructuredClient({
    security: { apiKeyAuth: key }
});

const data = fs.readFileSync(inputFilepath);

client.general.partition({
    partitionParameters: {
        files: {
            content: data,
            fileName: inputFilepath
        },
        strategy: Strategy.Auto
    }
}).then((res) => {
    if (res.statusCode == 200) {
       const jsonElements = JSON.stringify(res.elements, null, 2)
       
       // Print the processed data.
       console.log(jsonElements);

       // Write the processed data to a local file.
       fs.writeFileSync(outputFilepath, jsonElements)
    }
}).catch((e) => {
    if (e.statusCode) {
        console.log(e.statusCode);
        console.log(e.body);
    } else {
        console.log(e);
    }
});
```

### Calling the Unstructured API from the Unstructured open source library

You can call the Unstructured Serverless API directly from the Unstructured open source library. Unstructured recommends this approach only for rapid local script or code prototyping or simple proofs-of-concept, not for production scenarios:

You will need to: 

- Install Python, and then install the open source library:

  ```bash
  pip install unstructured
  ```

- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key.

Now, call the API, replacing:

- `<local/path/to/input/file>` with the path to the source (input) file on your local machine.
- `<local/path/to/output/file>` with the path to the destination (output) on your local machine where Unstructured will deliver the processed data. 

```python
import os, json

from unstructured.partition.api import partition_via_api

input_filepath = "<local/path/to/input/file>"
output_filepath = "<local/path/to/output/file>"

elements = partition_via_api(
  filename=input_filepath,
  api_key=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY")
)

element_dicts = [element.to_dict() for element in elements]
json_elements = json.dumps(element_dicts, indent=2)

# Print the processed data to a local file.
print(json_elements)

# Write the processed data to a local file.
with open(output_filepath, "w") as file:
    file.write(json_elements)
```

If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.
