title: Free Unstructured API
description: This page describes how to obtain an API key to use with the free Unstructured API, the limitations of the free Unstructured API, and provides a quickstart example.
---

## Get an API key

The Free Unstructured API requires authentication via an API key. Here's how you can obtain your API key:

1.  Navigate to the [Free Unstructured API](https://unstructured.io/api-key-free) page on our website.
2.  Fill out the registration form with your details: first name, last name, email, and company. Make sure your contact information is valid.
3.  Check the `I agree` box if you consent to Unstructured contacting you about our products and services.
4.  Carefully read the Terms and Conditions, and check the appropriate box to agree.
5.  Click "Submit". You will receive an API key to the provided email.

Make sure to store your API key securely, and do not share publicly.

<Note>
    When using the Free Unstructured API, you only need the API key to authenticate yourself.
    If you're using the Unstructured Serverless API, refer to the [Unstructured Serverless API](/api-reference/api-services/saas-api-development-guide) for the quickstart documentation.
</Note>

## Free Unstructured API limitations

The free Unstructured API is designed for prototyping purposes, and not for production use:
* The API usage is limited to 1000 pages per month.
* Unlike the users of Unstructured Serverless API, users of the free to do not get their own dedicated infrastructure.
* The data sent over the free Unstructured API can be used for model training purposes, and other service improvements.

If you require a production-ready API, consider using the [Unstructured Serverless API](/api-reference/api-services/saas-api-development-guide) instead.

## Quick Start Example

Let's say you want to preprocess an `*.eml` file using the free Unstructured API. There are several ways
you can do this, which all lead to the same result, so pick your preferred method.

<Info>When using the Free Unstructured API, use `https://api.unstructured.io/general/v0/general` as the URL for `POST` requests, or a blank string as the URL when using the CLI, SDKs, or open source library. Note that the Free API URL has a slightly different domain name than the Serverless API which is `api.unstructuredapp.io`.</Info>

### POST request

To work with the Unstructured Serverless API by calling the Unstructured REST API POST with `curl`, you will need to set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your Unstructured API key.

Now, use `curl` to call the API, specifying where the source (input) file is to preprocess and the destination (output) where Unstructured will deliver the processed data:

```bash
curl -X POST $UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL \
     -H 'accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
     -H 'unstructured-api-key: $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY' \
     -F 'files=@<local/path/to/input/file>' \
     -o '<local/path/to/output/file>'
```

The result will look something like this:

<Info>`POST` requests support using only local machine paths as the source (input) for the file to preprocess and as the destination (output) that Unstructured sends the processed data to. To specify a source or destination other than a local machine, use the CLI, the Python SDK, or the open source library instead.</Info>

### Unstructured CLI

To work with the Free Unstructured API by using the Unstructured CLI, you will need to:

- Install Python, and then install the CLI package:

  ```bash
  pip install unstructured
  ```

- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key.

Now, use the CLI to call the API, specifying where the files are to preprocess and where Unstructured will output the processed data.

```bash CLI
unstructured-ingest \
  local \
    --input-path <local/path/to/input/files> \
    --output-dir <local/path/to/output/files> \
    --partition-by-api \
    --api-key $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY
```

### Unstructured Python SDK and JavaScript/TypeScript SDK

To work with the free Unstructured API in Python or JavaScript, use the
Unstructured [Python SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-python-client), or
[JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-js-client).

To work with the Unstructured Serverless API in Python, JavaScript, or TypeScript, use the
Unstructured [Python SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-python-client) or
[JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-js-client).

<Info>The JavaScript/TypeScript SDK supports using only local machine paths as the source (input) for the files to preprocess and as the destination (output) that Unstructured sends the processed data to. To specify a source or destination other than a local machine, use the CLI, the Python SDK, or the open source library instead.</Info>

First, install your preferred SDK:
<CodeGroup>

```bash
pip install unstructured-client
```

```bash  JavaScript/TypeScript
npm install unstructured-client
```
</CodeGroup>

Next, use it to call the API. Be sure to set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your 
Unstructured Serverless API key to authenticate yourself.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import os

import unstructured_client
from unstructured_client.models import operations, shared

client = unstructured_client.UnstructuredClient(
    api_key_auth=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY")
)

filename = "sample-docs/layout-parser-paper.pdf"
file = open(filename, "rb")

res = client.general.partition(request=operations.PartitionRequest(
    partition_parameters=shared.PartitionParameters(
        files=shared.Files(
            content=file.read(),
            file_name=filename,
        ),
        # Other parameters.
        strategy=shared.Strategy.HI_RES,
        chunking_strategy=shared.ChunkingStrategy.BY_PAGE,
    ),
))

if res.elements is not None:
    # handle response
    pass
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { UnstructuredClient } from "unstructured-client";
import { PartitionResponse } from "unstructured-client/dist/sdk/models/operations";
import * as fs from "fs";

const key = process.env.UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY;

const client = new UnstructuredClient({
    security: {
        apiKeyAuth: key,
    },
});

const filename = "PATH_TO_FILE";
const data = fs.readFileSync(filename);

client.general.partition({
    files: {
        content: data,
        fileName: filename,
    },
}).then((res: PartitionResponse) => {
    if (res.statusCode == 200) {
        console.log(res.elements);
    }
}).catch((e) => {
    console.log(e.statusCode);
    console.log(e.body);
});
```
</CodeGroup>

### Calling the Unstructured API from the Unstructured open source library

You can call the Unstructured Serverless API directly from the Unstructured open source library. Unstructured recommends this approach only for rapid local script or code prototyping or simple proofs-of-concept, not for production scenarios:

You will need to: 

- Install Python, and then install the open source library:

  ```bash
  pip install unstructured
  ```

- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key.

Now, use the open source library to call the API, specifying the file to preprocess:

```python
import os

from unstructured.partition.api import partition_via_api

filename = "PATH_TO_FILE"

elements = partition_via_api(
  filename=filename,
  api_key=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY")
)
```
