## Get an API key

The Free Unstructured API requires authentication via an API key. Here's how you can obtain your API key:

1.  Go to [https://unstructured.io/api-key-free](https://unstructured.io/api-key-free).
2.  Fill out the registration form. Make sure your contact information (especially your **Email**) is valid.
3.  Check the **I agree** box if you consent to Unstructured contacting you about our products and services.
4.  Click the **Terms and Conditions** link, read it, and check the related box to agree.
5.  Click **Submit**. You will receive a Free Unstructured API key at the **Email** you provided. Store your API key in a secure location. Do not share it with others.
6.  For the Free Unstructured API, the API URL is `https://api.unstructured.io/general/v0/general`

import FreeKeyNoServerlessURL from '/snippets/general-shared-text/free-api-key-no-serverless-access.mdx';

## Free Unstructured API limitations

The Free Unstructured API is designed for prototyping purposes, and not for production use:
* The API usage is limited to 1000 pages per month.
* Unlike the users of Unstructured Serverless API, users of the Free Unstructured API to do not get their own dedicated infrastructure.
* The data sent over the Free Unstructured API can be used for model training purposes, and other service improvements.

If you require a production-ready API, consider using the [Unstructured Serverless API](/api-reference/api-services/saas-api-development-guide) instead.

## Quickstart

Let's say you want to preprocess an `*.eml` file using the free Unstructured API. There are several ways
you can do this, which all lead to the same result, so pick your preferred method: [POST](#post-request), [CLI](#unstructured-cli), [SDK](#unstructured-python-sdk-and-javascript-typescript-sdk), or [open source](#calling-the-unstructured-api-from-the-unstructured-open-source-library).

### POST request

To work with the Unstructured Serverless API by calling the Unstructured REST API POST with `curl`, first do the following:

- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your Free Unstructured API key.
- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` environment variable to your Free Unstructured API URL, which is `https://api.unstructured.io/general/v0/general`

Now, use `curl` to call the API, specifying where the source (input) file is to preprocess and the destination (output) where Unstructured will deliver the processed data:

```bash
curl -X POST $UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL \
     -H 'accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
     -H 'unstructured-api-key: $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY' \
     -F 'files=@<local/path/to/input/file>' \
     -o '<local/path/to/output/file>'
```

If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

The result will look something like this:

<Info>`POST` requests support using only local machine paths as the source (input) for the file to preprocess and as the destination (output) that Unstructured sends the processed data to. To specify a source or destination other than a local machine, use the [CLI](#unstructured-cli), the [Python SDK](#unstructured-python-sdk-and-javascript-typescript-sdk), or the [open source library](#calling-the-unstructured-api-from-the-unstructured-open-source-library) instead.</Info>

### Unstructured CLI

To work with the Free Unstructured API by using the Unstructured CLI, you will need to:

- Install Python, and then install the CLI package:

  ```bash
  pip install unstructured
  ```

- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your Free Unstructured API key.
- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` environment variable to your Free Unstructured API URL, which is `https://api.unstructured.io/general/v0/general`

Now, use the CLI to call the API, specifying where the files are to preprocess and where Unstructured will output the processed data.

```bash CLI
unstructured-ingest \
  local \
    --input-path <local/path/to/input/files> \
    --output-dir <local/path/to/output/files> \
    --partition-by-api \
    --api-key $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY \
    --partition-endpoint $UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL
```

If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

To learn more about how to use the `local` command, run the command `unstructured-ingest local --help`.

### Unstructured Python SDK and JavaScript/TypeScript SDK

To work with the free Unstructured API in Python or JavaScript, use the
Unstructured [Python SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-python-client), or
[JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-js-client).

To work with the Unstructured Serverless API in Python, JavaScript, or TypeScript, use the
Unstructured [Python SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-python-client) or
[JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-js-client).

<Info>The JavaScript/TypeScript SDK supports using only local machine paths as the source (input) for the files to preprocess and as the destination (output) that Unstructured sends the processed data to. To specify a source or destination other than a local machine, use the [CLI](#unstructured-cli), the Python SDK, or the [open source library](#calling-the-unstructured-api-from-the-unstructured-open-source-library) instead.</Info>

Install your preferred SDK:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python
pip install unstructured-client
```

```bash  JavaScript/TypeScript
npm install unstructured-client
```
</CodeGroup>

Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your Free Unstructured API key.

Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` environment variable to your Free Unstructured API URL, which is `https://api.unstructured.io/general/v0/general`

Now call the API. 

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import os

import unstructured_client
from unstructured_client.models import operations, shared

client = unstructured_client.UnstructuredClient(
    api_key=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"),
    server_url=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL")
)

filename = "sample-docs/layout-parser-paper.pdf"
file = open(filename, "rb")

res = client.general.partition(request=operations.PartitionRequest(
    partition_parameters=shared.PartitionParameters(
        files=shared.Files(
            content=file.read(),
            file_name=filename,
        ),
        # Other parameters.
        strategy=shared.Strategy.HI_RES,
        chunking_strategy=shared.ChunkingStrategy.BY_PAGE,
    ),
))

if res.elements is not None:
    # handle response
    pass
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { UnstructuredClient } from "unstructured-client";
import { PartitionResponse } from "unstructured-client/dist/sdk/models/operations";
import * as fs from "fs";

const key = process.env.UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY;
const url = process.env.UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL;

const client = new UnstructuredClient({
    security: {
        apiKeyAuth: key,
    },
    serverUrl: url
});

const filename = "PATH_TO_FILE";
const data = fs.readFileSync(filename);

client.general.partition({
    files: {
        content: data,
        fileName: filename,
    },
}).then((res: PartitionResponse) => {
    if (res.statusCode == 200) {
        console.log(res.elements);
    }
}).catch((e) => {
    console.log(e.statusCode);
    console.log(e.body);
});
```

### Calling the Unstructured API from the Unstructured open source library

You can call the Unstructured Serverless API directly from the Unstructured open source library. Unstructured recommends this approach only for rapid local script or code prototyping or simple proofs-of-concept, not for production scenarios:

You will need to: 

- Install Python, and then install the open source library:

  ```bash
  pip install unstructured
  ```

- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your Free Unstructured API key.
- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` environment variable to your Free Unstructured API URL, which is `https://api.unstructured.io/general/v0/general`

Now, use the open source library to call the API, specifying the file to preprocess:

```python
import os

from unstructured.partition.api import partition_via_api

filename = "PATH_TO_FILE"

elements = partition_via_api(
  filename=filename,
  api_key=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"),
  parition_endpoint=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL")
)
```

If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.
