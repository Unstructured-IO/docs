title: Process an individual file by using the Unstructured JavaScript/TypeScript SDK
sidebarTitle: JavaScript/TypeScript SDK
---

The [Unstructured JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-js-client) client allows you to send an individual file for processing by Unstructured API services. Whether you're using the
Free Unstructured API, the Unstructured Serverless API, the Unstructured API on Azure/AWS, or your local
deployment of the Unstructured API, you can access the API using the JavaScript/TypeScript SDK. 

import UseIngestOrPlatformInstead from '/snippets/general-shared-text/use-ingest-or-platform-instead.mdx';

<UseIngestOrPlatformInstead />

To use the JavaScript/TypeScript SDK, you'll need:

import SharedAPIKeyURL from '/snippets/general-shared-text/api-key-url.mdx';

<SharedAPIKeyURL />

import NoURLForServerlessAPI from '/snippets/general-shared-text/no-url-for-serverless-api.mdx';

<NoURLForServerlessAPI/>

## Installation

    Before using the SDK to interact with Unstructured API services, install the library:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash JavaScript/TypeScript
    npm install unstructured-client
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Note>
        The SDK uses semantic versioning and major bumps could bring breaking changes. It is advised to
        pin your installed version.
    </Note>

## Basics
    Let's start with a simple example in which you send a PDF document to be partitioned with the free Unstructured API:

    <Warning>
         The JavaScript/TypeScript SDK has the following breaking changes in v0.11.0:
         * Imports under the `dist` path have moved up a level
         * Enums are now used for parameters with a set of options
           * This includes `chunkingStrategy`, `outputFormat`, and `strategy`
         * All parameters to `partition` have moved to a `partitionParameters` object
    </Warning>

    <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { UnstructuredClient } from "unstructured-client";
    import { PartitionResponse } from "unstructured-client/sdk/models/operations";
    import { Strategy } from "unstructured-client/sdk/models/shared";
    import * as fs from "fs";

    const key = process.env.UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY;
    const url = process.env.UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL;

    const client = new UnstructuredClient({
        serverURL: url,
        security: {
            apiKeyAuth: key,
        },
    });

    const filename = "PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE";
    const data = fs.readFileSync(filename);

    client.general.partition({
        partitionParameters: {
            files: {
                content: data,
                fileName: filename,
            },
            strategy: Strategy.HiRes,
            splitPdfPage: true,
            splitPdfAllowFailed: true,
            splitPdfConcurrencyLevel: 15
            languages: ['eng']
        }
    }).then((res: PartitionResponse) => {
        if (res.statusCode == 200) {
            // Print the processed data's first element only.
            console.log(res.elements?.[0])

            // Write the processed data to a local file.
            const jsonElements = JSON.stringify(res.elements, null, 2)

            fs.writeFileSync("PATH_TO_OUTPUT_FILE", jsonElements)
        }
    }).catch((e) => {
        if (e.statusCode) {
          console.log(e.statusCode);
          console.log(e.body);
        } else {
          console.log(e);
        }
    });
    ```
    ```typescript TypeScript (SDK <=v0.10.6)
    import { UnstructuredClient } from "unstructured-client";
    import { PartitionResponse } from "unstructured-client/dist/sdk/models/operations";
    import * as fs from "fs";

    const key = process.env.UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY;
    const url = process.env.UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL;

    const client = new UnstructuredClient({
        serverURL: url,
        security: {
            apiKeyAuth: key,
        },
    });

    const filename = "PATH_TO_FILE";
    const data = fs.readFileSync(filename);

    client.general.partition({
        files: {
            content: data,
            fileName: filename,
        },
        strategy: 'hi_res',
        languages: ['eng']
    }).then((res: PartitionResponse) => {
        if (res.statusCode == 200) {
            console.log(res.elements?.[0]);
        }
    }).catch((e) => {
      if (e.statusCode) {
        console.log(e.statusCode);
        console.log(e.body);
      } else {
        console.log(e);
      }
    });
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    For a code example that works with an entire directory of files instead of just a single PDF, see the [Processing multiple files](#processing-multiple-files) section.

## Page splitting

    In order to speed up processing of large PDF files, the `splitPdfPage`[*](#parameter-names) parameter is `true` by default. This
    causes the PDF to be split into small batches of pages before sending requests to the API. The client
    awaits all parallel requests and combines the responses into a single response object. This is specific to PDF files and other
    filetypes are ignored.

    The number of parallel requests is controlled by `splitPdfConcurrencyLevel`[*](#parameter-names). 
    The default is 8 and the max is set to 15 to avoid high resource usage and costs.

    If at least one request is successful, the responses are combined into a single response object. An
    error is returned only if all requests failed or there was an error during splitting.

    <Note>
    This feature may lead to unexpected results when chunking because the server does not see the entire
    document context at once. If you'd like to chunk across the whole document and still get the speedup from 
    parallel processing, you can:
    * Partition the PDF with `splitPdfPage` set to `true`, without any chunking parameters.
    * Store the returned elements in `results.json`.
    * Partition this JSON file with the desired chunking parameters.
    </Note>

    ```typescript TypeScript
    client.general.partition({
        partitionParameters: {
            files: {
                content: data,
                fileName: filename,
            },
            strategy: Strategy.HiRes,
            // Set to `false` to disable PDF splitting
            splitPdfPage: true,
            // Continue PDF splitting even if some earlier split operations fail.
            splitPdfAllowFailed: true,
            // Modify splitPdfConcurrencyLevel to set the number of parallel requests
            splitPdfConcurrencyLevel: 10,
        }
    })
    ```

## Customizing the client
    ### Retries
        You can also change the defaults for retries through the `retryConfig`[*](#parameter-names)
        when initializing the client. If a request to the API fails, the client will retry the 
        request with an exponential backoff strategy up to a maximum interval of one minute. The
        function keeps retrying until the total elapsed time exceeds `maxElapsedTime`[*](#parameter-names),
        which defaults to one hour:

        ```typescript TypeScript
        const key = process.env.UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY;
        const url = process.env.UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL;    

        const client = new UnstructuredClient({
            security: { apiKeyAuth: key },
            serverURL: url,
            retryConfig: {
                strategy: "backoff",
                retryConnectionErrors: true,
                backoff: {
                    initialInterval: 500,
                    maxInterval: 60000,
                    exponent: 1.5,
                    maxElapsedTime: 900000, // 15min*60sec*1000ms = 15 minutes
                },
            };
        });
        ```

## Processing multiple files

    The code example in the [Basics](#basics) section processes a single PDF file. But what if you want to process 
    multiple files inside a directory with a mixture of subdirectories and files with different file types?

    The following example takes an input directory path to read files from and an output directory path to 
    write the processed data to, processing one file at a time.

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { UnstructuredClient } from "unstructured-client";
    import * as fs from "fs";
    import * as path from "path";
    import { Strategy } from "unstructured-client/sdk/models/shared/index.js";
    import { PartitionResponse } from "unstructured-client/sdk/models/operations";

    // Send all files in the source path to Unstructured for processing.
    // Send the processed data to the destination path.
    function processFiles(
        client: UnstructuredClient,
        sourcePath: string,
        destinationPath: string
    ): void {

        // If an output directory does not exist for the corresponding input
        // directory, then create it.
        if (!fs.existsSync(destinationPath)) {
            fs.mkdirSync(destinationPath, { recursive: true });
        }

        // Get all folders and files at the current level of the input directory.
        const items = fs.readdirSync(sourcePath);

        // For each folder and file in the input directory...
        for (const item of items) {
            const inputPath = path.join(sourcePath, item);
            const outputPath = path.join(destinationPath, item)

            // If it's a folder, call this function recursively.
            if (fs.statSync(inputPath).isDirectory()) {
                processFiles(client, inputPath, outputPath);
            } else {
                // If it's a file, send it to Unstructured for processing.
                const data = fs.readFileSync(inputPath);

                client.general.partition({
                    partitionParameters: {
                        files: {
                            content: data,
                            fileName: inputPath
                        },
                        strategy: Strategy.HiRes,
                        splitPdfPage: true,
                        splitPdfConcurrencyLevel: 15,
                        splitPdfAllowFailed: true
                    }
                }).then((res: PartitionResponse) => {
                    // If successfully processed, write the processed data to
                    // the destination directory.
                    if (res.statusCode == 200) {
                        const jsonElements = JSON.stringify(res.elements, null, 2)
                        fs.writeFileSync(outputPath + ".json", jsonElements)
                    }
                }).catch((e) => {
                    if (e.statusCode) {
                        console.log(e.statusCode);
                        console.log(e.body);
                    } else {
                        console.log(e);
                    }
                });
            }
        }
    }

    const client = new UnstructuredClient({
        security: { apiKeyAuth: process.env.UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY },
        serverURL: process.env.UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL
    });

    processFiles(
        client,
        process.env.LOCAL_FILE_INPUT_DIR,
        process.env.LOCAL_FILE_OUTPUT_DIR
    );
    ```

## Parameters & examples

The parameter names used in this document are for the JavaScript/TypeScript SDK, which follow camelCase
