title: Unstructured API on AWS
description: Follow these steps to deploy the Unstructured API service into your AWS account.
---

You will need:

1.  **An AWS account**: 

    * If you have an existing account, log in: [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com) > **Sign In to the Console**.
    
    * If you do not have an existing account, create one: [https://aws.amazon.com/free](https://aws.amazon.com/free) > **Create a Free Account**.

2.  **IAM permissions**: In a later step, AWS CloudFormation creates required infrastructure in your account. To learn how to create the associated role, see [Creating IAM Roles with AWS CloudFormation](https://blog.awsfundamentals.com/aws-iam-roles-with-aws-cloudformation#heading-creating-iam-roles-with-aws-cloudformation).
        
3.  **SSH key pair**: For secure access to the Amazon EC2 instance that CloudFormation creates in a later step, create an SSH key pair. To learn how, see [Create a key pair for your Amazon EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-key-pairs.html).

## Part I: Setting up the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

_Note: If you have already configured a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for your organization that meets the requirements for deploying the Unstructured API, you may skip this part and proceed to the Part II. Ensure that your existing VPC setup includes the necessary subnets, internet gateway, and route tables as outlined in this guide._

In Part I, you will construct a resilient and secure infrastructure within AWS by setting up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Your VPC will encompass a dual-tiered subnet model consisting of both **public** and **private** subnets across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).

You will establish the foundational network structure for deploying the Unstructured API by creating two public subnets and one private subnet within your VPC. The public subnets will host resources that require direct access to the internet, such as a load balancer, enabling them to communicate with external users. The private subnet is designed for resources that should not be directly accessible from the internet, like EC2 Compute Engine.

1.  **Access the VPC dashboard**:
    
    a.   In the AWS Management Console, in the top menu bar, click **Services > Networking & Content Delivery > VPC**.<br/>

    b.   In the sidebar, click **Your VPCs**, and then click **Create VPC**.<br/>

2.  **Create the VPC**:
    
    a.   Select **VPC only**.<br/>
        
    b.   Enter a **Name tag** for your VPC.<br/>
        
    c.   Specify the **IPv4 CIDR block** (for example, `10.0.0.0/16`).<br/>
    
    d.   You may leave **IPv6 CIDR block**, **Tenancy**, and **Tags** settings at their defaults.<br/>
            
    e.   Click **Create VPC**.

3.  **Create the subnets**:
    
    a.   After creating the VPC, in the sidebar, click **Subnets**.<br/>
        
    b.   Click **Create subnet**.<br/>
    
    c.   In the **VPC ID** dropdown menu. select the VPC that you just created.<br/>
        
    d.   For the first public subnet:<br/>
        
        *   Enter a **Subnet name**.
            
        *   Select an **Availability Zone**.
            
        *   Specify the **IPv4 CIDR block** (for example, `10.0.0.0/16`).
            
        *   Specify the **IPv4 subnet CIDR block** (for example, `10.0.1.0/24`).
            
        *   You may leave the **Tags** setting at its default.
            
        *   Click **Add new subnet**. (Do not click **Create subnet** yet.)
            
    e.  Repeat the process for the second public subnet with a different **Availability Zone** and **IPv4 subnet CIDR block** (for example, `10.0.2.0/24`).<br/>
        
        *   _Note: Each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones. If you specify the same Availability Zone or IPv4 subnet CIDR block as the first public subnet, AWS CloudFormation might fail in a later step_.
            
        *   To learn more, see [Subnet basics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/configure-subnets.html#subnet-basics).

        *   Click **Add new subnet**. (Do not click **Create subnet** yet.)
            
    f.  Repeat the process for the private subnet with a different **Availability Zone** and **IPv4 subnet CIDR block** (for example, `10.0.3.0/24`).<br/>

        *   _Note: Each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones. If you specify the same Availability Zone or IPv4 subnet CIDR block as the first or second public subnets, AWS CloudFormation might fail in a later step_.
            
    g.  Click **Create subnet**.

4.  **Create the internet gateway (for the public subnets)**:
    
    a.   In the sidebar, click **Internet gateways**.<br/>
        
    b.   Click **Create internet gateway**, enter a **Name tag**, and click **Create internet gateway**.<br/>
        
    c.   In the sidebar, click **Internet gateways** again.<br/>

    d.   Click the **Internet gateway ID** for the internet gateway that you just created.<br/>

    e.   Click **Actions > Attach to VPC**.<br/>

    f.   In the **Available VPCs** dropdown list, select the VPC from _Step 2 - Create the VPC_.<br/>

    g.   Click **Attach internet gateway**.<br/>
            

![create internet gateway](/img/api/VPC_Step4.png)

5.  **Set up route tables (for the public subnets)**:

    AWS automatically created a default route table in _Step 3 - Create the subnets_. To tailor your network architecture, you will create a new route table specifically for your public subnets, which will include a route to the internet gateway from _Step 4 - Create the internet gateway (for the public subnets)_.
    
    a.   In the sidebar, click *Route tables*.

    b.   Click **Create route table**.
        
    c.   Enter a **Name**.
        
    d.   Select the **VPC** from _Step 2 - Create the VPC_.
        
    e.   Click **Create route table**.
        

![create route table](/img/api/VPC_Step5.png)

6.  **Associate public subnets to the route table and internet gateway**:
    
    a.  Connect the **public subnets** to the **route table** from _Step 5 - Set up route tables (for the public subnets)_:<br/>
        
        *   In the sidebar, click **Subnets**.

        *   Select the first public subnet from _Step 3 - Create the subnets_.
            
        *   Click **Actions > Edit route table association**.
            
        *   In the **Route table ID** dropdown list, select the route table from _Step 5 - Set up route tables (for the public subnets)_, and then click **Save**.
            
        *   Repeat the process for the second public subnet.
            
    b.   Now, youâ€™ll ensure that the two public subnets can access the internet by connecting the route table to the internet gateway:<br/>
        
        *   In the sidebar, click **Route tables**.
            
        *   Select the route table from _Step 5 - Set up route tables (for the public subnets)_.
            
        *   Click **Actions > Edit routes**.
            
        *   Click **Add route**, in the destination box, enter `0.0.0.0/0`, which represents all IP addresses. In the **Target** dropdown list, select **Internet Gateway**, and select the internet gateway from _Step 4 - Create the internet gateway (for the public subnets)_.
            
        *   Click **Save changes** to establish the route, granting internet access to the first and second public subnets at the same time.
            
    c.  For the **private subnet**:
    
        *   In the sidebar, click **Subnets**.

        *   Select the private subnet from _Step 3 - Create the subnets_.
            
        *   Click **Actions > Edit route table association**.
            
        *   In the **Route table ID** dropdown list, select the main route table, or create and then select a new route table without a route to the internet gateway.
        
        *   Click **Save**.

![CloudFormation Configuration](/img/api/Marketplace_Step9.png)

10.  **Create the CloudFormation stack**:
    
    After you click **Launch**, the **Create stack** page appears in CloudFormation.
    
    **Step 1: Create the stack**
    
    a.   Leave **Choose an existing template** selected.
        
    b.   Leave **Amazon S3 URL** selected and the default **Amazon S3 URL** value unchanged.
        
    c.   Click **Next**.
        
    
    ![Create Stack](/img/api/Marketplace_Step10a.png)
    
    **Step 2: Specify the stack's details**
    
    a.   Enter some unique **Stack name**.
        
    b.   In the **Parameters** section, for **KeyName**, select the name of the SSH key pair from the beginning of this article.

    c.   In the **LoadBalancerScheme** dropdown list, select **internet-facing**.
        
    d.   For **SSHLocation**, enter `0.0.0.0/0`, but only if you allow public access on the internet.
        
        *   **Note**: It is generally recommended to limit SSH access to a specific IP range for enhanced security. This can be done by setting the `SSHLocation` to the IP address or range associated with your organization. Please consult your IT department or VPN vendor to obtain the correct IP information for these settings.
            
        *   AWS provides `AWS Client VPN`, which is a managed client-based VPN service that enables secure access AWS resources and resources in your on-premises network. To learn more, see [Getting started with AWS Client VPN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/cvpn-getting-started.html).
            
    e.   In the **Subnets** dropdown multiselect list, select the two public subnets and the private subnet from Part I. 
    
    f.   In the **VPC** dropdown list, select the VPC from Part I.
        
    g.   You can leave the default values for all of the other **Parameters** fields.
        
    h.   Click **Next** button.
        
    
    ![Specify stack details](/img/api/Marketplace_Step10b.png)
    
    **Step 3: Configure the stack's options**

    b.   Click **Submit**.
        
    
    ![Review stack](/img/api/Marketplace_Step10d.png)
11.  **Get the Unstructured API endpoint**:
    
    a.   Check the status of the CloudFormation stack. A successful deployment will show a **CREATE_COMPLETE** status on the **Stack Info** tables. The deployment can take several minutes.
            
    b.   Click the **Resources** tab, click the **ApplicationLoadBalancer** link.
        
    c.   On the **EC2 > Load balancers > (Load balancer ID)** page, copy the **DNS Name** value, which is shown as an **(A Record)** and ends with `.elb.amazonaws.com`.
        
         - Note: You will use this **DNS Name** to replace the `<application-load-balancer-dns-name>` for the following healthcheck and data processing steps.
            

![Unstructured API Endpoint](/img/api/Marketplace_Step11.png)

## Healthcheck

Perform a health check by running this `curl` command, replacing `<application-load-balancer-dns-name>` with your application load balancer's DNS name:

```bash
curl http://<application-load-balancer-dns-name>/healthcheck

```


![Healthcheck](/img/api/healthcheck.png)

## Data processing

For example, run one of the following, setting the following environment variables to make your code more portable:

- Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` to `http://`, followed by your load balancer's DNS name, followed by `/general/v0/general`.
- Set `LOCAL_FILE_INPUT_DIR` to the path on your local machine to the files for the Unstructured API to process. If you do not have any input files available, you can download any of the ones from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in GitHub.
- Set `LOCAL_FILE_OUTPUT_DIR` to the path on your local machine for Unstructured API to send the processed output in JSON format.:
