title: Process an individual file by using the Unstructured Python SDK
sidebarTitle: Python SDK
---

The [Unstructured Python SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-python-client) client allows you to send an individual file for processing by Unstructured API services. Whether you're using the
Free Unstructured API, the Unstructured Serverless API, the Unstructured API on Azure/AWS, or your local
deployment of the Unstructured API, you can access the API using the Python SDK. 

import UseIngestInstead from '/snippets/general-shared-text/use-ingest-instead.mdx';

<UseIngestInstead />

To use the Python SDK, you'll need:

import SharedAPIKeyURL from '/snippets/general-shared-text/api-key-url.mdx';

<SharedAPIKeyURL />

import NoURLForServerlessAPI from '/snippets/general-shared-text/no-url-for-serverless-api.mdx';

<NoURLForServerlessAPI/>

## Installation

    Before using the SDK to interact with Unstructured API services, install the library:

    ```bash Python
    pip install unstructured-client
    ```

    <Note>
        The SDK uses semantic versioning and major bumps could bring breaking changes. It is advised to
        pin your installed version. See the [migration guide](#migration-guide), later on this page, for breaking change announcements.
    </Note>

## Basics
    Let's start with a simple example in which you send a PDF document to be partitioned with the Unstructured API. Note that the Python SDK gives you a choice of two interfaces. The functionality is identical, but the Pydantic model syntax may provide completion hints in your IDE, for instance.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python (TypedDict example)
    import os, json

    import unstructured_client
    from unstructured_client.models import shared

    client = unstructured_client.UnstructuredClient(
        api_key_auth=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"),
        server_url=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL"),
    )

    filename = "PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE"

    req = {
        "partition_parameters": {
            "files": {
                "content": open(filename, "rb"),
                "file_name": filename,
            },
            "strategy": shared.Strategy.HI_RES,
            "languages": ['eng'],
            "split_pdf_page": True,
        }
    }

    try:
        res = client.general.partition(request=req)
        element_dicts = [element for element in res.elements]

        # Print the processed data's first element only.
        print(element_dicts[0])

        # Write the processed data to a local file.
        json_elements = json.dumps(element_dicts, indent=2)

        with open("PATH_TO_OUTPUT_FILE", "w") as file:
            file.write(json_elements)
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
    ```
    ```python Python (Pydantic model example)
    import os, json

    import unstructured_client
    from unstructured_client.models import operations, shared

    client = unstructured_client.UnstructuredClient(
        api_key_auth=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"),
        server_url=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL"),
    )

    filename = "PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE"

    req = operations.PartitionRequest(
        partition_parameters=shared.PartitionParameters(
            files=shared.Files(
                content=open(filename, "rb"),
                file_name=filename,
            ),
            strategy=shared.Strategy.HI_RES,
            languages=['eng'],
            split_pdf_page=True,
        ),
    )

    try:
        res = client.general.partition(request=req)
        element_dicts = [element for element in res.elements]
        
        # Print the processed data's first element only.
        print(element_dicts[0])

        # Write the processed data to a local file.
        json_elements = json.dumps(element_dicts, indent=2)

        with open("PATH_TO_OUTPUT_FILE", "w") as file:
            file.write(json_elements)
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

## Async Partitioning

    The Python SDK also has a `partition_async`. This call is equivalent to `partition` except that it can be used in a non blocking context. For instance, `asyncio.gather` can be used to concurrently process multiple files at once, as demonstrated here: 

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python
    import asyncio
    import os, json

    import unstructured_client
    from unstructured_client.models import shared

    client = unstructured_client.UnstructuredClient(
        api_key_auth=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"),
        server_url=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL"),
    )

    async def call_api(filename):
        req = {
            "partition_parameters": {
                "files": {
                    "content": open(filename, "rb"),
                    "file_name": filename,
                },
                "strategy": shared.Strategy.HI_RES,
            }
        }

        try:
            res = await client.general.partition_async(request=req)

            element_dicts = [element for element in res.elements]

            json_elements = json.dumps(element_dicts, indent=2)

            output_filename = filename + ".json"  # Save off the json response alongside the input file
            with open(output_filename, "w") as file:
                file.write(json_elements)

        except Exception as e:
            print(e)

    async def process_files(filenames):
        filenames = [
            "PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE_1",
            "PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE_2",
            "PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE_3",
        ]

        tasks = []

        for filename in filenames:
            tasks.append(call_api(filename))

        await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

    asyncio.run(process_files())
    ```
    </CodeGroup>


## Page splitting

    In order to speed up processing of large PDF files, the `split_pdf_page`[*](#parameter-names) parameter is `True` by default. This
    causes the PDF to be split into small batches of pages before sending requests to the API. The client
    awaits all parallel requests and combines the responses into a single response object. This is specific to PDF files and other
    filetypes are ignored.

    The number of parallel requests is controlled by `split_pdf_concurrency_level`[*](#parameter-names). 
    The default is 8 and the max is set to 15 to avoid high resource usage and costs.

    If at least one request is successful, the responses are combined into a single response object. An
    error is returned only if all requests failed or there was an error during splitting.

    <Note>
    This feature may lead to unexpected results when chunking because the server does not see the entire
    document context at once. If you'd like to chunk across the whole document and still get the speedup from 
    parallel processing, you can:
    * Partition the PDF with `split_pdf_page` set to `True`, without any chunking parameters.
    * Store the returned elements in `results.json`.
    * Partition this JSON file with the desired chunking parameters.
    </Note>

    ```python Python
    req = operations.PartitionRequest(
        partition_parameters=shared.PartitionParameters(
            files=shared.Files(
                content=file.read(),
                file_name=filename,
            ),
            strategy=shared.Strategy.HI_RES,
            split_pdf_page=True,            # If True, splits the PDF file into smaller chunks of pages.
            split_pdf_allow_failed=True,    # If True, the partitioning continues even if some pages fail.
            split_pdf_concurrency_level=15  # Set the number of concurrent request to the maximum value: 15.
        )
    )
    res = client.general.partition(req)
    ```

## Customizing the client
    ### Retries
        You can also change the defaults for retries through the `retry_config`[*](#parameter-names)
        when initializing the client. If a request to the API fails, the client will retry the 
        request with an exponential backoff strategy up to a maximum interval of one minute. The
        function keeps retrying until the total elapsed time exceeds `max_elapsed_time`[*](#parameter-names),
        which defaults to one hour:

        ```python Python
        import os 

        client = UnstructuredClient(
            api_key_auth=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"),
            server_url=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL"),
            retry_config=RetryConfig(
                strategy="backoff",
                retry_connection_errors=True,
                backoff=BackoffStrategy(
                    # time intervals are defined in milliseconds
                    initial_interval=500,
                    max_interval=60000,
                    exponent=1.5,
                    max_elapsed_time=900000,  # 15min*60sec*1000ms = 15 minutes
                ),
            )
        )
        ```

    ### Disabling SSL validation

        If you disable SSL validation, requests will accept any TLS certificate
        presented by the server and ignore hostname mismatches and/or expired certificates, 
        which will make your application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
        Only set this to `False` for testing.

        ```python Python
        http_client = requests.Session()
        http_client.verify = False

        client = UnstructuredClient(
            client=http_client,
            ...
        )
        ```

## Handling the response

    The partition response defaults to a dict format that can be converted to Unstructured elements with
    the `elements_from_dicts` utility function as seen below. Otherwise, the API response can be sent directly 
    to your vector store or another destination.

    ```python Python
    from unstructured.staging.base import elements_from_dicts

    # ...

    if res.elements is not None:
        elements = elements_from_dicts(response.elements)
    ```

## Parameters & examples

The parameter names used in this document are for the Python SDK, which follow snake_case convention. The JavaScript/TypeScript SDK follows camelCase
convention. Other than this difference in naming convention, 
the names used in the SDKs are the same across all methods.

* Refer to the [API parameters](/api-reference/api-services/api-parameters) page for the full list of available parameters.
* Refer to the [Examples](/api-reference/api-services/examples) page for some inspiration on using the parameters.

## Migration guide

### Upgrading to 0.26.0

- If you see the error: `AttributeError: 'PartitionParameters' object has no attribute 'partition_parameters'`

Previously, the SDK has accepted a PartitionParameters object as input to the sdk.general.partition function. Now, this object must be wrapped in a PartitionRequest object. The old behavior was deprecated in 0.23.0 and removed in 0.26.0.

```python
# Instead of:
from unstructured_client.models import shared

req = shared.PartitionParameters(
    files=files,
)

resp = s.general.partition(request=req)


# Switch to:
from unstructured_client.models import shared, operations

req = operations.PartitionRequest(
    partition_parameters=shared.PartitionParameters(
        files=files,
    )
)

resp = s.general.partition(request=req)
```

- If you see the error: `TypeError: BaseModel.__init__() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given`

In 0.26.0 the PartitionRequest constructor no longer allows for positional arguments. You must specify partition_parameters by name.

```python
# Instead of:
req = operations.PartitionRequest(
    shared.PartitionParameters(
        files=files,
    )
)

# Switch to:
req = operations.PartitionRequest(
    partition_parameters=shared.PartitionParameters(
        files=files,
    )
)
```

- If you see the error: `TypeError: General.partition() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given`

Likewise, in 0.26.0 the partition function no longer allows for positional arguments. You must specify request by name.

```python
# Instead of:
resp = s.general.partition(req)

# Switch to:
resp = s.general.partition(request=req)
```
