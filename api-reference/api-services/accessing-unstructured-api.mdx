Whether you're using the free Unstructured API, the SaaS Unstructured API, Unstructured API on Azure/AWS or your local
deployment of Unstructured API, you have several methods of accessing it. The functionality is the same across different methods.

Choose your preferred method:

* [Sending POST requests to Unstructured API](/api-reference/api-services/post-requests)
* [Using Python SDK](/api-reference/api-services/python-sdk)
* [Using JavaScript SDK](/api-reference/api-services/javascript-sdk)
* [Using API by calling `partition_via_api()` from Python code](/api-reference/api-services/partition-via-api)

The API parameters for all these methods are documented on the [API parameters](/api-reference/api-services/api-parameters) page.
