---

## Sign in to get started with the Unstructured Serverless API

To connect to Unstructured Serverless API you need to obtain the API URL and a unique API key:

1. Navigate to the [Unstructured Serverless API](https://unstructured.io/api-key-hosted) page on our website.
2. Enter your valid email address to receive a magic link to sign in to your personalized dashboard, or
authenticate yourself with either your Google or GitHub account.
3. Once authenticated either via Google/GitHub, or via the magic link sent to your email, you'll find your newly generated Unstructured API key in your dashboard.

On the same page as your API key(s), you'll find the Unstructured API URL.
Save your API key and the API URL securely, as you will need them to access the Unstructured Serverless API and integrate it with your applications.

## Set up billing

Once you sign up for Unstructured API, you can enjoy a free 14-day trial with usage capped at 1000 pages per day.
At the end of the trial, or if you need to exceed the trial's limit, you need to set up your billing information to proceed using
the Unstructured Serverless API.

1. Log in to your personal dashboard.
2. Navigate to the Billing tab on the left side of the screen.
3. Click on the **Manage Payment Method** button. This will take you to the Stripe page. Specify your credit card details, and click Save card.

Your card will be billed monthly based on the usage. You can see the billing overview for the ongoing month on the Billing page of your dashboard.

## Quickstart Example

The following example illustrates how to preprocess an `*.eml` file using the Unstructured Serverless API.
The functionality is similar to the free Unstructured API, the main difference is that in addition to your API key,
you must provide the API URL from your dashboard.

There are several ways to use the Unstructured Serverless API, which all lead to the same result, so pick your preferred method. Regardless of the method you pick, you will need:

import SharedAPIKeyURL from '/snippets/general-shared-text/api-key-url.mdx';

<SharedAPIKeyURL />

### POST request

To work with the Unstructured Serverless API by calling the Unstructured REST API POST with `curl`, you will need to:

- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your Unstructured API key.
- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` environment variable to the complete Unstructured API URL that you can find
in your dashboard on the **API keys** page.

Now, use `curl` to call the API, specifying where the source (input) file is to preprocess and the destination (output) where Unstructured will deliver the processed data:

```bash
curl -X POST $UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL \
     -H 'accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
     -H 'unstructured-api-key: $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY' \
     -F 'files=@<local/path/to/input/file>' \
     -o '<local/path/to/output/file>'
```

The result will look something like this:

<Info>`POST` requests support using only local machine paths as the source (input) for the files to preprocess and as the destination (output) that Unstructured sends the processed data to. To specify a source or destination other than a local machine, use the CLI, the Python SDK, or the open source library instead.</Info>

import SharedPOSTSingleFile from '/snippets/general-shared-text/post-api-single-file.mdx';

<SharedPOSTSingleFile />

### Unstructured CLI

To work with the Unstructured Serverless API by using the Unstructured CLI, you will need to:

- Install Python, and then install the CLI package:

  ```bash
  pip install unstructured
  ```

- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key. Make sure to also set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` environment variable to the complete Unstructured Serverless API URL that you can find
in your dashboard on the **API keys** page.

Now, use the CLI to call the API, specifying where the source (input) files are to preprocess and the destination (output) where Unstructured will deliver the processed data:

```bash CLI
unstructured-ingest \
  local \
    --input-path <local/path/to/input/files> \
    --output-dir <local/path/to/output/files> \
    --partition-by-api \
    --api-key $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY \
    --partition-endpoint $UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL
```

### Unstructured Python SDK and JavaScript/TypeScript SDK

To work with the Unstructured Serverless API in Python, JavaScript, or TypeScript, use the
Unstructured [Python SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-python-client) or
[JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-js-client).

<Info>The JavaScript/TypeScript SDK supports using only local machine paths as the source (input) for the files to preprocess and as the destination (output) that Unstructured sends the processed data to. To specify a source or destination other than a local machine, use the CLI, the Python SDK, or the open source library instead.</Info>

First, install your preferred SDK:
<CodeGroup>

```bash  Python
pip install unstructured-client
```

```bash  JavaScript/TypeScript
npm install unstructured-client
```
</CodeGroup>

Next, use it to call the API. Be sure to set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` environment variable to the API URL from your dashboard. Also set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your 
Unstructured Serverless API key to authenticate yourself.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import os

import unstructured_client
from unstructured_client.models import operations, shared

client = unstructured_client.UnstructuredClient(
    api_key_auth=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"),
    server_url=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL"),
)

filename = "PATH_TO_FILE"
with open(filename, "rb") as f:
    data = f.read()

req = operations.PartitionRequest(
    partition_parameters=shared.PartitionParameters(
        files=shared.Files(
            content=data,
            file_name=filename,
        ),
        # --- Other partition parameters. ---
        strategy=shared.Strategy.AUTO,
        languages=['eng'],
    ),
)

try:
    res = client.general.partition(request=req)
    print(res.elements[0])
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { UnstructuredClient } from "unstructured-client";
import { PartitionResponse } from "unstructured-client/sdk/models/operations";
import { Strategy } from "unstructured-client/sdk/models/shared";
import * as fs from "fs";

const key = process.env.UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY;
const url = process.env.UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL;

const client = new UnstructuredClient({
    serverURL: url,
    security: {
        apiKeyAuth: key,
    },
});

const filename = "PATH_TO_FILE";
const data = fs.readFileSync(filename);

client.general.partition({
    partitionParameters: {
        files: {
            content: data,
            fileName: filename,
        },
        // --- Other partition parameters. ---
        strategy: Strategy.Auto,
        languages: ['eng'],
    }
}).then((res: PartitionResponse) => {
    if (res.statusCode == 200) {
        console.log(res.elements);
    }
}).catch((e) => {
    if (e.statusCode) {
        console.log(e.statusCode);
        console.log(e.body);
    } else {
        console.log(e);
    }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

### Calling the Unstructured API from the Unstructured open source library

You can call the Unstructured Serverless API directly from the Unstructured open source library. Unstructured recommends this approach only for rapid local script or code prototyping or simple proofs-of-concept, not for production scenarios:

You will need to: 

- Install Python, and then install the open source library:

  ```bash
  pip install unstructured
  ```

- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key. Make sure to set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` environment variable to the complete Unstructured Serverless API URL that you can find
in your dashboard on the **API keys** page.

Now, use the open source library to call the API, specifying the file to preprocess:

```python
import os 

from unstructured.partition.api import partition_via_api

filename = "PATH_TO_FILE"

elements = partition_via_api(
  filename=filename,
  api_key=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"),
  api_url=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL")
)
```

## Unstructured Serverless API Account Maintenance

Log in to your Unstructured API dashboard to manage your account:

* Go to the **API keys** page to generate new API keys, deactivate existing keys.
* Review the details on the **Usage** page to understand the breakdown of processed documents.
* Track your costs, and manage payment methods on the **Billing** page.
