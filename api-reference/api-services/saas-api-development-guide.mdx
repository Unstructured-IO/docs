## Set up billing

Once you sign up for the Unstructured Serverless API, you can enjoy a free 14-day trial with usage capped at 1000 pages per day.

<Info>The free 14-day trial for the Unstructured Serverless API is different than the [Free Unstructured API](/api-reference/api-services/free-api).</Info>

At the end of the 14-day free trial, or if you need to go past the trial's page processing limits during the 14-day free trial, you must set up your billing information to keep using
the Unstructured Serverless API:

1. Go to [https://app.unstructured.io](https://app.unstructured.io) and sign in.
2. On the sidebar, click **Billing**.
3. Click **Manage Payment Method**, follow the on-screen instructions to enter your payment details through Stripe, and then click **Save card**.

Your card is billed monthly based on your usage. The **Billing** page shows a billing overview for the current month and a list of your billing invoices.

## Quickstart

These examples use your local machine. They preprocess a single-file source (input) file on your local machine, and the Unstructured Serverless API delivers the processed data to a destination (output) location, also on your local machine. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

<Info>
    These examples work with only a single file at a time and only with local source and destination locations. To process multiple files at a time, or to use non-local source or destination locations, use the [Unstructured Python Ingest CLI](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-cli) or the [Unstructured Ingest Python library](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-python-library) instead.
</Info>

There are several ways to use the Unstructured Serverless API, which all lead to the same result, so pick your preferred method: [POST](#post-request), [CLI](#unstructured-ingest-cli), [SDK](#unstructured-python-sdk-and-javascript-typescript-sdk), or [open source](#calling-the-unstructured-api-from-the-unstructured-open-source-library).

### POST request

To work with the Unstructured Serverless API by calling the Unstructured REST API POST with `curl`, you will need to:

- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your Unstructured Serverless API key.
- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` environment variable to your Unstructured Serverless API URL.

[Get your API key and API URL](#get-started).

Now, use `curl` to call the API, replacing:

- `<local/path/to/input/file>` with the path to the source (input) file on your local machine.
- `<local/path/to/output/file>` with the path to the destination (output) on your local machine where Unstructured will deliver the processed data. 

```bash
curl -X POST $UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL \
     -H 'accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
     -H 'unstructured-api-key: $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY' \
     -F 'files=@<local/path/to/input/file>' \
     -o '<local/path/to/output/file>'
```

After the command successfully runs, see the results in the specified output path on your local machine.

If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

### Unstructured Ingest CLI

<Info>Although this example works with only a single file at a time and only with local source and destination locations, the Unstructured Ingest CLI works with multiple files at a time and with non-local source and destination locations. [Learn more](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-cli).</Info>

To work with the Unstructured Serverless API by using the [Unstructured Ingest CLI](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-cli), you will need to:

- Install Python, and then install the CLI package:

  ```bash
  pip install unstructured
  ```

- Set the following environment variables:

  - Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` to your API key.
  - Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` to your API URL.
  
  [Get your API key and API URL](#get-started).

Now, use the CLI to call the API, replacing:

- `<local/path/to/input/files>` with the path to the source (input) file on your local machine.
- `<local/path/to/output/file>` with the path to the destination (output) on your local machine where Unstructured will deliver the processed data. 

```bash CLI
unstructured-ingest \
  local \
    --input-path <local/path/to/input/file> \
    --output-dir <local/path/to/output/file> \
    --partition-by-api \
    --api-key $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY \
    --partition-endpoint $UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL
```

After the command successfully runs, see the results in the specified output path on your local machine.

If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

### Unstructured Python SDK and JavaScript/TypeScript SDK

To work with the Unstructured Serverless API in Python, JavaScript, or TypeScript, use the
[Unstructured Python SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-python-client) or the 
[Unstructured JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-js-client).

To get started with the Unstructured Python SDK even faster than following the steps below, simply sign up for a 14-day trial of the Unstructured Serverless API at [https://app.unstructured.io](https://app.unstructured.io), and then follow along with this 3-minute video:

First, install your preferred SDK:
<CodeGroup>

```bash  Python
pip install unstructured-client
```

```bash  JavaScript/TypeScript
npm install unstructured-client
```
</CodeGroup>

Next, set the following environment variables:

- Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` environment variable to your API URL.
- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key.

[Get your API key and API URL](#get-started). 

Now, call the API, replacing:

- `<local/path/to/input/file>` with the path to the source (input) file on your local machine.
- `<local/path/to/output/file>` with the path to the destination (output) on your local machine where Unstructured will deliver the processed data.

client = UnstructuredClient(
    api_key_auth=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"),
    server_url=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL"),
)

with open(input_filepath, "rb") as f:
    files = shared.Files(
        content=f.read(),
        file_name=input_filepath
    )

const client = new UnstructuredClient({
    security: { apiKeyAuth: key },
    serverURL: url
});

const data = fs.readFileSync(inputFilepath);

            fileName: inputFilepath
        },
        splitPdfPage: true,
        splitPdfConcurrencyLevel: 15
    }
}).then((res) => {
    if (res.statusCode == 200) {
       const jsonElements = JSON.stringify(res.elements, null, 2)
       
       // Print the processed data.
       console.log(jsonElements);

       // Write the processed data to a local file.
       fs.writeFileSync(outputFilepath, jsonElements)
    }
}).catch((e) => {
    if (e.statusCode) {
        console.log(e.statusCode);
        console.log(e.body);
    } else {
        console.log(e);
    }
});

### Calling the Unstructured API from the Unstructured open source library

You can call the Unstructured Serverless API directly from the Unstructured open source library. Unstructured recommends this approach only for rapid local script or code prototyping or simple proofs-of-concept, not for production scenarios.

You will need to: 

- Set the following environment variables:

  - Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` to your API key.
  - Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` to your API URL.
  
  [Get your API key and API URL](#get-started).

Now, call the API, replacing:

- `<local/path/to/input/file>` with the path to the source (input) file on your local machine.
- `<local/path/to/output/file>` with the path to the destination (output) on your local machine where Unstructured will deliver the processed data. 

```python
import os, json

from unstructured.partition.api import partition_via_api

input_filepath = "<local/path/to/input/file>"
output_filepath = "<local/path/to/output/file>"

elements = partition_via_api(
  filename=input_filepath,
  api_key=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"),
  api_url=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL")
)

element_dicts = [element.to_dict() for element in elements]
json_elements = json.dumps(element_dicts, indent=2)

# Print the processed data.
print(json_elements)

# Write the processed data to a local file.
with open(output_filepath, "w") as file:
    file.write(json_elements)
```

After the code successfully runs, see the results in the specified output path on your local machine.

If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.
