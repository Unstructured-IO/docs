---

<Note>
    The Unstructured Serverless API is separate from the Unstructured Platform API. 
    
    For information about the 
    Unstructured Platform API, see the [Unstructured Platform API Overview](/platform/api/overview).
</Note>

This page describes how to get started with the Unstructured Serverless API. Learn how to obtain an API key to use with the Unstructured Serverless API, and get started in no time.

## Get started

To call the Unstructured Serverless API, you need an Unstructured account, API key, and API URL:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Sign up">
        To sign up for an Unstructured account, go to the [For Developers](https://unstructured.io/developers) page and choose one of the following plans:

        - Sign up for a [pay-per-page plan](https://unstructured.io/developers#get-started).
        - Save money by signing up for a [subscribe-and-save plan](https://unstructured.io/subscribeandsave) instead.

        If you're not sure which plan to sign up for, start with a [pay-per-page plan](https://unstructured.io/developers#get-started). You can always switch plans later.

        <Note>
            If you choose a pay-per-page plan, after your first 14 days of usage or more than 1000 processed pages per day, 
            whichever comes first, your account is then billed at Unstructured's standard service usage rates. To keep using the service, 
            you must provide Unstructured with your payment details.
            
            To save money by switching from a pay-per-page to a subscribe-and-save plan, go to the 
            [Unstructured Subscribe & Save](https://unstructured.io/subscribeandsave) page and complete the on-screen instructions.
            
            By signing up for a pay-per-page or subscribe-and-save plan, your Unstructured account will run within the context of the Unstructured Platform on 
            Unstructured's own hosted cloud resources. If you would rather run the Unstructured Platform within the context of your own virtual private cloud (VPC), 
            (or you want to save even more money by making a long-term billing commitment), 
            stop here and sign up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead.
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Sign in">
        <Note>
            If you initially signed up for a subscribe-and-save plan instead of a pay-per-page plan, wait to complete this step until after you receive confirmation from Unstructured that your 
            plan is activated. Then go to the Unstructured home page at [https://unstructured.io](https://unstructured.io) and click **Login**.

            If you signed up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead, your sign-in process will 
            be different. For enterprise sign-in guidance, contact Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).
        </Note>

        1. After you have signed up for a pay-per-page plan, the Unstructured Platform sign-in page appears.

           ![Sign in to your Unstructured account](/img/platform/Signin.png)
        
        2. Click **Google** or **GitHub** to sign in with the Google or GitHub account that you signed up with. 
           Or, enter the email address that you signed up with, and then click **Sign In**.
        3. If you entered your email address, check your email inbox for a message from Unstructured. In that email, click the **Sign In** link.
        4. The first time you sign in, read the terms and conditions, and then click **Accept**.

        <Tip>
            After you have signed in for the first time, you can 
            sign in the second time and beyond by going to the Unstructured home page at [https://unstructured.io](https://unstructured.io) and clicking **Login**.
        
            For enterprise sign-in guidance, contact Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).

        1. After you have signed in to your Unstructured account, at the bottom of the sidebar, click your user icon, and then click **Account Settings**.
        2. On the **API Keys** tab, click **Generate New Key**.
        3. Enter some descriptive name for the API key, and then click **Save**.
        4. Click the **Copy** icon for your new API key. The API key's value is copied to your system's clipboard.
        5. Note the Unstructured **Serverless API URL**, which is `https://api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general`

        ![Unstructured Serverless API URL](/img/platform/ServerlessAPIURL.png)

        <Warning>
            Do not use the Unstructured **Platform API URL**, which is separate from the Unstructured Serverless API URL.
        </Warning>

        <Note>
            If you signed up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page, your API URL 
            might be different. For API URL guidance, email Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io). 
            If your API URL is different, be sure to substitute `https://api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general` for your 
            API URL throughout the following examples.
        </Note>

## Set up billing

If you signed up for a pay-per-page plan, you can enjoy a free 14-day trial with usage capped at 1000 pages per day.

<Note>
    If you initially signed up for a subscribe-and-save plan instead, of if you signed up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead, your billing setup and terms will 
    be different. For billing guidance, contact Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).
    
    The free 14-day trial for the Unstructured Serverless API is different than the [Free Unstructured API](/api-reference/api-services/free-api).
</Note>

At the end of the 14-day free trial, or if you need to go past the trial's page processing limits during the 14-day free trial, you must set up your billing information to keep using
the Unstructured Serverless API:

![Unstructured account settings](/img/platform/AccountSettings.png)

![Unstructured account payment method](/img/platform/AccountBillingPaymentMethod.png)

1. Sign in to the Unstructured Platform.
2. At the bottom of the sidebar, click your user icon, and then click **Account Settings**.
3. Click the **Billing** tab.
4. Click **Manage Payment Method**, follow the on-screen instructions to enter or update your payment details, and then click **Save card**.

Your card is billed monthly based on your usage. The **Billing** page shows a billing overview for the current month and a list of your billing invoices.

<Tip>
    You can save money by switching from a pay-per-page plan to a subscribe-and-save plan. To do this, 
    go to the [Unstructured Subscribe & Save](https://unstructured.io/subscribeandsave) page and complete the on-screen instructions.

## Quickstart

These examples use your local machine. They send source (input) files from your local machine to the Unstructured Serverless API which delivers the processed data to a destination (output) location, also on your local machine. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

### Unstructured Ingest CLI

To work with the Unstructured Serverless API by using the [Unstructured Ingest CLI](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-cli), you will need to:

- Install Python, and then install the CLI package:

  ```bash
  pip install unstructured-ingest
  ```

- Set the following environment variables:

  - Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` to your API key.
  - Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` to your API URL.
  
  [Get your API key and API URL](#get-started).

- Have some compatible files on your local machine to be processed. [See the list of supported file types](/api-reference/api-services/supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

Now, use the CLI to call the API, replacing:

- `<path/to/input>` with the source (input) path to the directory on your local machine that contains the compatible files for Unstructured to process on its hosted compute resources.
- `<path/to/output>` with the destination (output) path to the directory on your local machine that will contain the processed data that Unstructured returns from its hosted compute resources.

```bash CLI
unstructured-ingest \
  local \
    --input-path <path/to/input> \
    --output-dir <path/to/output> \
    --partition-by-api \
    --api-key $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY \
    --partition-endpoint $UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL \
    --strategy hi_res \
    --additional-partition-args="{\"split_pdf_page\":\"true\", \"split_pdf_allow_failed\":\"true\", \"split_pdf_concurrency_level\": 15}"
```

After the command successfully runs, see the results in the specified output path on your local machine.
