## Set up billing

Once you sign up for the Unstructured Serverless API, you can enjoy a free 14-day trial with usage capped at 1000 pages per day.

<Info>The free 14-day trial for the Unstructured Serverless API is different than the [Free Unstructured API](/api-reference/api-services/free-api).</Info>

At the end of the 14-day free trial, or if you need to go past the trial's page processing limits during the 14-day free trial, you must set up your billing information to keep using
the Unstructured Serverless API:

1. Go to [https://app.unstructured.io](https://app.unstructured.io) and sign in.
2. On the sidebar, click **Billing**.
3. Click **Manage Payment Method**, follow the on-screen instructions to enter your payment details through Stripe, and then click **Save card**.

## Quickstart

These examples use your local machine. They send source (input) files from your local machine to the Unstructured Serverless API which delivers the processed data to a destination (output) location, also on your local machine. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

### Unstructured Ingest CLI

To work with the Unstructured Serverless API by using the [Unstructured Ingest CLI](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-cli), you will need to:

- Install Python, and then install the CLI package:

  ```bash
  pip install unstructured-ingest
  ```

- Set the following environment variables:

  - Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` to your API key.
  - Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` to your API URL.
  
  [Get your API key and API URL](#get-started).

- Have some compatible files on your local machine to be processed. [See the list of supported file types](/api-reference/api-services/supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

Now, use the CLI to call the API, replacing:

- `<path/to/input>` with the source (input) path to the directory on your local machine that contains the compatible files for Unstructured to process on its hosted compute resources.
- `<path/to/output>` with the destination (output) path to the directory on your local machine that will contain the processed data that Unstructured returns from its hosted compute resources.

```bash CLI
unstructured-ingest \
  local \
    --input-path <path/to/input> \
    --output-dir <path/to/output> \
    --partition-by-api \
    --api-key $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY \
    --partition-endpoint $UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL \
    --strategy hi_res \
    --additional-partition-args="{\"split_pdf_page\":\"true\", \"split_pdf_allow_failed\":\"true\", \"split_pdf_concurrency_level\": 15}"
```

After the command successfully runs, see the results in the specified output path on your local machine.

### Unstructured Ingest Python library

To work with the Unstructured Serverless API by using the [Unstructured Python library](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-python-library), you will need to:

- Install Python, and then install the CLI package:

  ```bash
  pip install unstructured-ingest
  ```

- Set the following environment variables:

  - Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` to your API key.
  - Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` to your API URL.
  
  [Get your API key and API URL](#get-started).

- Have some compatible files on your local machine to be processed. [See the list of supported file types](/api-reference/api-services/supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

Now, use the CLI to call the API, replacing:

- `<path/to/input>` with the source (input) path to the directory on your local machine that contains the compatible files for Unstructured to process on its hosted compute resources.
- `<path/to/output>` with the destination (output) path to the directory on your local machine that will contain the processed data that Unstructured returns from its hosted compute resources.

import LocalToLocalPythonIngestLibrary from '/snippets/ingestion/local-to-local.v2.py.mdx';

<LocalToLocalPythonIngestLibrary />

After the command successfully runs, see the results in the specified output path on your local machine.
