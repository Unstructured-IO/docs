## Get an API Key

Each user of the SaaS Unstructured API receives a unique API URL that requires authentication via their API key.
Here's how you can obtain your API key and unique API URL:

1.  Navigate to the [SaaS Unstructured API](https://unstructured.io/api-key-hosted) page on our website.
2.  Fill out the registration form with your details: first name, last name, email, and company. Make sure your contact information is valid.
3.  Optional preferences:
    * Check the box to sign up for future marketing emails and product updates.
    * (**Recommended**) Check the box to sign up for weekly API usage updates.
4.  Read and accept our terms and conditions by checking the appropriate box to proceed.
5.  Click "Submit" to create your account. You will receive an API key, a unique API URL and further instructions to the provided email.

Save your API key and the unique API URL securely, as you will need them to access the SaaS Unstructured API and integrate it with your applications.

## Set up billing

Once you receive your SaaS Unstructured API key and a unique API URL, set up your billing information:

[//]: # (TODO: this will need to be updated once we have the dashboard)

1. At the end of the email you will find the payment link that will lead you to Stripe.
2. Fill out your billing information.
    *   There will be a small initiation fee for all new subscriptions. This one-time fee will be charged to your credit card to enable automatic billing.
3.  Click the “Pay this invoice” button in the email and follow the instructions to enter your payment details securely on the Stripe website.
4.  Confirm the payment to complete this process. Look out for any confirmation prompts or messages that signify a successful transaction.
    *   Note that we don’t send out a receipt. If you want to keep a receipt, click the “Download invoice” button after completing the payment on Stripe.

## Quick Start Example

The following example illustrates how to preprocess an `*.eml` file using the SaaS Unstructured API.
The functionality is similar to the free Unstructured API, the main difference is that in addition to your API key,
you must provide the unique API URL.

There are several ways to use the SaaS Unstructured API, which all lead to the same result, so pick your preferred method.

### POST request

Supply your API key, and the file to preprocess. Make sure to copy the complete SaaS Unstructured API URL provided in
your email, i.e. this URL should include the specific path `/general/v0/general`:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'https://YOUR_API_URL' \
     -H 'accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
     -H 'unstructured-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
     -F 'files=@PATH_TO_FILE'
```

The result will look something like this:

### Unstructured Python/JavaScript SDK

To work with the SaaS Unstructured API in Python or JavaScript, use the
Unstructured [Python SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-python-client), or
[JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-js-client).

First, install your preferred SDK:
<CodeGroup>

```bash  Python
pip install unstructured-client
```

```bash  JavaScript
npm install unstructured-client
```
</CodeGroup>

Next, use it to call the API. Be sure to use the base API URL, the one that does NOT end with the path `/general/v0/general`,
from the email you received. Double-check that you use `https` in the URL to prevent potential errors. Use your SaaS
Unstructured API key to authenticate yourself.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import unstructured_client
from unstructured_client.models import operations, shared

client = unstructured_client.UnstructuredClient(
    api_key_auth="YOUR_API_KEY",
    # server_url="YOUR_API_URL",
)

filename = "PATH_TO_FILE"
with open(filename, "rb") as f:
    data = f.read()

req = operations.PartitionRequest(
    partition_parameters=shared.PartitionParameters(
        files=shared.Files(
            content=data,
            file_name=filename,
        ),
        # --- Other partition parameters ---
        strategy=shared.Strategy.AUTO,  
        languages=['eng'],
    ),
)

try:
    res = client.general.partition(request=req)
    print(res.elements[0])
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

```javascript JavaScript
import { UnstructuredClient } from "unstructured-client";
import { PartitionResponse } from "unstructured-client/sdk/models/operations";
import { Strategy } from "unstructured-client/sdk/models/shared";
import * as fs from "fs";

const key = "YOUR_API_KEY";

const client = new UnstructuredClient({
    // serverURL: "YOUR_API_URL",
    security: {
        apiKeyAuth: key,
    },
});

const filename = "PATH_TO_FILE";
const data = fs.readFileSync(filename);

client.general.partition({
    partitionParameters: {
        files: {
            content: data,
            fileName: filename,
        },
        strategy: Strategy.Auto,
        languages: ['eng'],
    }
}).then((res: PartitionResponse) => {
    if (res.statusCode == 200) {
        console.log(res.elements);
    }
}).catch((e) => {
    if (e.statusCode) {
        console.log(e.statusCode);
        console.log(e.body);
    } else {
        console.log(e);
    }
});
```
</CodeGroup>


### Calling the Unstructured API from the Unstructured open source library

Finally, you can call the SaaS Unstructured API directly from the Unstructured open source library:

```python
from unstructured.partition.api import partition_via_api

filename = "PATH_TO_FILE"

elements = partition_via_api(
  filename=filename,
  api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
  api_url="https://YOUR_API_HOSTNAME.api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general"
)
```
