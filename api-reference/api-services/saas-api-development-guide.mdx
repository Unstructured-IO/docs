## Sign in to get started with the SaaS Unstructured API

Each user of the SaaS Unstructured API receives a unique API URL that requires authentication via their API key.
Here's how you can obtain your API key and unique API URL:

1. Navigate to the [SaaS Unstructured API](https://unstructured.io/api-key-hosted) page on our website.
2. Enter your valid email address to receive a magic link to sign in to your personalized dashboard, or
authenticate yourself with either your Google or GitHub account.
3. Once authenticated either via Google/GitHub, or via the magic link sent to your email, you'll find your newly generated Unstructured API key in your dashboard.

On the same page as your API key(s), you'll find the Unstructured API URL.
Save your API key and the API URL securely, as you will need them to access the SaaS Unstructured API and integrate it with your applications.

## Set up billing

Once you sign up for Unstructured API, you can enjoy a free 14-day trial with usage capped at 1000 pages per day.
At the end of the trial, or if you need to exceed the trial's limit, you need to set up your billing information to proceed using
the SaaS Unstructured API.

1. Log in to your personal dashboard.
2. Navigate to the Billing tab on the left side of the screen.
3. Click on the **Manage Payment Method** button. This will take you to the Stripe page. Specify your credit card details, and click Save card.

Your card will be billed monthly based on the usage. You can see the billing overview for the ongoing month on the Billing page of your dashboard.

## Quick Start Example

The following example illustrates how to preprocess an `*.eml` file using the SaaS Unstructured API.
The functionality is similar to the free Unstructured API, the main difference is that in addition to your API key,
you must provide the unique API URL.

There are several ways to use the SaaS Unstructured API, which all lead to the same result, so pick your preferred method.

### POST request

Supply your API key, and the file to preprocess. Make sure to copy the complete SaaS Unstructured API URL that you can find
in your dashboard on the **API keys** page:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'https://YOUR_API_URL' \
     -H 'accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
     -H 'unstructured-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
     -F 'files=@PATH_TO_FILE'
```

The result will look something like this:

### Unstructured Python/JavaScript SDK

To work with the SaaS Unstructured API in Python or JavaScript, use the
Unstructured [Python SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-python-client), or
[JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-js-client).

First, install your preferred SDK:
<CodeGroup>

```bash  Python
pip install unstructured-client
```

```bash  JavaScript
npm install unstructured-client
```
</CodeGroup>

Next, use it to call the API. Be sure to supply the API URL from your dashboard. Use your SaaS
Unstructured API key to authenticate yourself.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import unstructured_client
from unstructured_client.models import operations, shared

client = unstructured_client.UnstructuredClient(
    api_key_auth="YOUR_API_KEY",
    server_url="YOUR_API_URL",
)

filename = "PATH_TO_FILE"
with open(filename, "rb") as f:
    data = f.read()

req = operations.PartitionRequest(
    partition_parameters=shared.PartitionParameters(
        files=shared.Files(
            content=data,
            file_name=filename,
        ),
        # --- Other partition parameters ---
        strategy=shared.Strategy.AUTO,  
        languages=['eng'],
    ),
)

try:
    res = client.general.partition(request=req)
    print(res.elements[0])
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

```javascript JavaScript
import { UnstructuredClient } from "unstructured-client";
import { PartitionResponse } from "unstructured-client/sdk/models/operations";
import { Strategy } from "unstructured-client/sdk/models/shared";
import * as fs from "fs";

const key = "YOUR_API_KEY";

const client = new UnstructuredClient({
    // serverURL: "YOUR_API_URL",
    security: {
        apiKeyAuth: key,
    },
});

const filename = "PATH_TO_FILE";
const data = fs.readFileSync(filename);

client.general.partition({
    partitionParameters: {
        files: {
            content: data,
            fileName: filename,
        },
        strategy: Strategy.Auto,
        languages: ['eng'],
    }
}).then((res: PartitionResponse) => {
    if (res.statusCode == 200) {
        console.log(res.elements);
    }
}).catch((e) => {
    if (e.statusCode) {
        console.log(e.statusCode);
        console.log(e.body);
    } else {
        console.log(e);
    }
});
```
</CodeGroup>


### Calling the Unstructured API from the Unstructured open source library

Finally, you can call the SaaS Unstructured API directly from the Unstructured open source library:

```python
from unstructured.partition.api import partition_via_api

filename = "PATH_TO_FILE"

elements = partition_via_api(
  filename=filename,
  api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
  api_url="YOUR_API_URL"
)
```

## SaaS Unstructured API Account Maintenance

Log in to your Unstructured API dashboard to manage your account:

* Go to the **API keys** page to generate new API keys, deactivate existing keys.
* Review the details on the **Usage** page to understand the breakdown of processed documents.
