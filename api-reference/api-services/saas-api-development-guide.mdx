## Set up billing

Once you sign up for the Unstructured Serverless API, you can enjoy a free 14-day trial with usage capped at 1000 pages per day.

<Info>The free 14-day trial for the Unstructured Serverless API is different than the [Free Unstructured API](/api-reference/api-services/free-api).</Info>

At the end of the 14-day free trial, or if you need to go past the trial's page processing limits during the 14-day free trial, you must set up your billing information to keep using
the Unstructured Serverless API:

1. Go to [https://app.unstructured.io](https://app.unstructured.io) and sign in.
2. On the sidebar, click **Billing**.
3. Click **Manage Payment Method**, follow the on-screen instructions to enter your payment details through Stripe, and then click **Save card**.

Your card is billed monthly based on your usage. The **Billing** page shows a billing overview for the current month and a list of your billing invoices.

## Quickstart

The following example illustrates how to preprocess an `*.eml` file using the Unstructured Serverless API.

There are several ways to use the Unstructured Serverless API, which all lead to the same result, so pick your preferred method: [POST](#post-request), [CLI](#unstructured-cli), [SDK](#unstructured-python-sdk-and-javascript-typescript-sdk), or [open source](#calling-the-unstructured-api-from-the-unstructured-open-source-library).

### POST request

To work with the Unstructured Serverless API by calling the Unstructured REST API POST with `curl`, you will need to:

- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your Unstructured Serverless API key.
- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` environment variable to your Unstructured Serverless API URL.

[Get your API key and API URL](#get-started).

Now, use `curl` to call the API, specifying where the source (input) file is to preprocess and the destination (output) where Unstructured will deliver the processed data. 

```bash
curl -X POST $UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL \
     -H 'accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
     -H 'unstructured-api-key: $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY' \
     -F 'files=@<local/path/to/input/file>' \
     -o '<local/path/to/output/file>'
```

If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

The result will look something like this:

![Sample Output](/img/api/sample_output.png)

<Info>`POST` requests support using only local machine paths as the source (input) for the files to preprocess and as the destination (output) that Unstructured sends the processed data to. To specify a source or destination other than a local machine, use the CLI, the Python SDK, or the open source library instead.</Info>

import SharedPOSTSingleFile from '/snippets/general-shared-text/post-api-single-file.mdx';

<SharedPOSTSingleFile />

[Learn more about how to use POST requests](/api-reference/api-services/post-requests).

### Unstructured CLI

To work with the Unstructured Serverless API by using the Unstructured CLI, you will need to:

- Install Python, and then install the CLI package:

  ```bash
  pip install unstructured
  ```

- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key. Make sure to also set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` environment variable to your API URL. [Get your API key and API URL](#get-started).

Now, use the CLI to call the API, specifying where the source (input) files are to preprocess and the destination (output) where Unstructured will deliver the processed data:

```bash CLI
unstructured-ingest \
  local \
    --input-path <local/path/to/input/files> \
    --output-dir <local/path/to/output/files> \
    --partition-by-api \
    --api-key $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY \
    --partition-endpoint $UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL
```

If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

To learn more about how to use the `local` command, run the command `unstructured-ingest local --help`.

### Unstructured Python SDK and JavaScript/TypeScript SDK

To work with the Unstructured Serverless API in Python, JavaScript, or TypeScript, use the
Unstructured [Python SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-python-client) or
[JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-js-client).

<Info>The JavaScript/TypeScript SDK supports using only local machine paths as the source (input) for the files to preprocess and as the destination (output) that Unstructured sends the processed data to. To specify a source or destination other than a local machine, use the [CLI](#unstructured-cli), the Python SDK, or the [open source library](#calling-the-unstructured-api-from-the-unstructured-open-source-library) instead.</Info>

First, install your preferred SDK:
<CodeGroup>

```bash  Python
pip install unstructured-client
```

```bash  JavaScript/TypeScript
npm install unstructured-client
```
</CodeGroup>

Next, use it to call the API. Be sure to set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` environment variable to your API URL Also set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key. [Get your API key and API URL](#get-started). 

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import os

import unstructured_client
from unstructured_client.models import operations, shared

client = unstructured_client.UnstructuredClient(
    api_key_auth=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"),
    server_url=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL"),
)

filename = "PATH_TO_FILE"
with open(filename, "rb") as f:
    data = f.read()

req = operations.PartitionRequest(
    partition_parameters=shared.PartitionParameters(
        files=shared.Files(
            content=data,
            file_name=filename,
        ),
        # --- Other partition parameters. ---
        strategy=shared.Strategy.AUTO,
        languages=['eng'],
    ),
)

try:
    res = client.general.partition(request=req)
    print(res.elements[0])
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { UnstructuredClient } from "unstructured-client";
import { PartitionResponse } from "unstructured-client/sdk/models/operations";
import { Strategy } from "unstructured-client/sdk/models/shared";
import * as fs from "fs";

const key = process.env.UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY;
const url = process.env.UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL;

const client = new UnstructuredClient({
    serverURL: url,
    security: {
        apiKeyAuth: key,
    },
});

const filename = "PATH_TO_FILE";
const data = fs.readFileSync(filename);

client.general.partition({
    partitionParameters: {
        files: {
            content: data,
            fileName: filename,
        },
        // --- Other partition parameters. ---
        strategy: Strategy.Auto,
        languages: ['eng'],
    }
}).then((res: PartitionResponse) => {
    if (res.statusCode == 200) {
        console.log(res.elements);
    }
}).catch((e) => {
    if (e.statusCode) {
        console.log(e.statusCode);
        console.log(e.body);
    } else {
        console.log(e);
    }
});
```

### Calling the Unstructured API from the Unstructured open source library

You can call the Unstructured Serverless API directly from the Unstructured open source library. Unstructured recommends this approach only for rapid local script or code prototyping or simple proofs-of-concept, not for production scenarios.

You will need to: 

- Install Python, and then install the open source library:

  ```bash
  pip install unstructured
  ```

- Set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key. Make sure to set the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` environment variable to your API URL. [Get your API key and API URL](#get-started). 

Now, use the open source library to call the API, specifying the file to preprocess:

```python
import os 

from unstructured.partition.api import partition_via_api

filename = "PATH_TO_FILE"

elements = partition_via_api(
  filename=filename,
  api_key=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"),
  api_url=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL")
)
```

If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

import SharedPartitionViaAPISingleFile from '/snippets/general-shared-text/multi-file-partition-via-api.mdx';
