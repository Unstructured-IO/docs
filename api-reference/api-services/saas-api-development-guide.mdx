## Get started

To call the Unstructured Serverless API, you need an API key and API URL:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Sign up">
        Go to the [For Developers](https://unstructured.io/developers) page and enter your information.

        <Note>
            By signing up through the [For Developers](https://unstructured.io/developers) page, your Unstructured account will run within the context of the Unstructured Platform on 
            Unstructured's own hosted cloud resources. Also, after your first 14 days of usage or more than 1000 processed pages per day, 
            whichever comes first, your account is then billed at Unstructured's standard service usage rates. You can always 
            start a prepaid subscription in exchange for usage rate discounts. To switch your account from a pay-as-you-go plan to a prepaid subscription, 
            contact Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).
            
            If you would rather run the Unstructured Platform within the context of your own virtual private cloud (VPC), 
            or you want to make a long-term billing commitment in exchange for deeply discounted service usage rates, 
            stop here and sign up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead.
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Sign in">
        ![Sign in to your Unstructured account](/img/platform/Signin.png)
        1. After you have signed up through the [For Developers](https://unstructured.io/developers) page, the Unstructured Platform sign-in page appears.

           <Note>
              If you signed up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead, your sign-in process will 
              be different. For enterprise sign-in guidance, contact Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).
           </Note>

        2. Click **Google** or **GitHub** to sign in with the Google or GitHub account that you signed up with through the **For Developers** page. 
           Or, enter the email address that you signed up with, and then click **Sign In**.
        3. If you entered your email address, check your email inbox for a message from Unstructured. In that email, click the **Sign In** link.
        4. The first time you sign in, read the terms and conditions, and then click **Accept**.

        <Tip>
            After you have signed in through the [For Developers](https://unstructured.io/developers) page for the first time, you can 
            sign in the second time and beyond by going to the Unstructured home page at [https://unstructured.io](https://unstructured.io) and clicking **Login**.
        
            For enterprise sign-in guidance, contact Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).

## Set up billing

Once you sign up for the Unstructured Serverless API through the [For Developers](https://unstructured.io/developers) page, you can enjoy a free 14-day trial with usage capped at 1000 pages per day.

<Note>
    If you signed up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead, your billing setup and terms will 
    be different. For enterprise billing guidance, contact Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).
    
    The free 14-day trial for the Unstructured Serverless API is different than the [Free Unstructured API](/api-reference/api-services/free-api).
</Note>

At the end of the 14-day free trial, or if you need to go past the trial's page processing limits during the 14-day free trial, you must set up your billing information to keep using
the Unstructured Serverless API:

![Unstructured account settings](/img/platform/AccountSettings.png)

![Unstructured account billing](/img/platform/AccountBilling.png)

1. Sign in to the Unstructured Platform.
2. At the bottom of the sidebar, click your user icon, and then click **Account Settings**.
3. On the account settings sidebar, click **Billing**.
4. Click **Manage Payment Method**, follow the on-screen instructions to enter your payment details through Stripe, and then click **Save card**.

Your card is billed monthly based on your usage. The **Billing** page shows a billing overview for the current month and a list of your billing invoices.

<Note>
    You can always 
    start a prepaid subscription in exchange for usage rate discounts. To switch your account from a pay-as-you-go plan to a prepaid subscription, 
    contact Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).

## Quickstart

These examples use your local machine. They send source (input) files from your local machine to the Unstructured Serverless API which delivers the processed data to a destination (output) location, also on your local machine. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

### Unstructured Ingest CLI

To work with the Unstructured Serverless API by using the [Unstructured Ingest CLI](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-cli), you will need to:

- Install Python, and then install the CLI package:

  ```bash
  pip install unstructured-ingest
  ```

- Set the following environment variables:

  - Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` to your API key.
  - Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` to your API URL.
  
  [Get your API key and API URL](#get-started).

- Have some compatible files on your local machine to be processed. [See the list of supported file types](/api-reference/api-services/supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

Now, use the CLI to call the API, replacing:

- `<path/to/input>` with the source (input) path to the directory on your local machine that contains the compatible files for Unstructured to process on its hosted compute resources.
- `<path/to/output>` with the destination (output) path to the directory on your local machine that will contain the processed data that Unstructured returns from its hosted compute resources.

```bash CLI
unstructured-ingest \
  local \
    --input-path <path/to/input> \
    --output-dir <path/to/output> \
    --partition-by-api \
    --api-key $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY \
    --partition-endpoint $UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL \
    --strategy hi_res \
    --additional-partition-args="{\"split_pdf_page\":\"true\", \"split_pdf_allow_failed\":\"true\", \"split_pdf_concurrency_level\": 15}"
```

After the command successfully runs, see the results in the specified output path on your local machine.

### Unstructured Ingest Python library

To work with the Unstructured Serverless API by using the [Unstructured Python library](/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-python-library), you will need to:

- Install Python, and then install the CLI package:

  ```bash
  pip install unstructured-ingest
  ```

- Set the following environment variables:

  - Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` to your API key.
  - Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` to your API URL.
  
  [Get your API key and API URL](#get-started).

- Have some compatible files on your local machine to be processed. [See the list of supported file types](/api-reference/api-services/supported-file-types). If you do not have any files available, you can download some from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in the Unstructured repo on GitHub.

Now, use the CLI to call the API, replacing:

- `<path/to/input>` with the source (input) path to the directory on your local machine that contains the compatible files for Unstructured to process on its hosted compute resources.
- `<path/to/output>` with the destination (output) path to the directory on your local machine that will contain the processed data that Unstructured returns from its hosted compute resources.

import LocalToLocalPythonIngestLibrary from '/snippets/ingestion/local-to-local.v2.py.mdx';
