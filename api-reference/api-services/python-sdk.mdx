title: Using Python SDK
description: This documentation covers the usage of the Python SDK for interacting with the Unstructured API.
---

The [Python SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-python-client) allows for easy interaction with the Unstructured API using Python.
Whether you're using the free Unstructured API, the SaaS Unstructured API, Unstructured API on Azure/AWS or your local
deployment of Unstructured API, you can access the API using the Python SDK.

## Installation

Before using the Python SDK to interact with your Unstructured API, install the library:

```bash
pip install unstructured-client
```

## Basics

<Note>
    Deprecation Warning: The legacy method of making API calls is currently supported, but it may be deprecated and could break in future releases. We advise all users to migrate to the new `PartitionRequest` object introduced in v0.25.0 to ensure compatibility with future updates.
</Note>
<Note>
    Deprecation Warning: Defining `strategy`, `chunking_strategy`, and `output_format` parameters as strings may also be deprecated and could break in future releases. It is also advised to use the new classes for defining those parameters. Ex: `shared.Strategy.HI_RES`
</Note>

Let's start with a simple example in which you send a pdf document to partition via Unstructured API using the Python SDK:

```python
import unstructured_client
from unstructured_client.models import operations, shared

client = unstructured_client.UnstructuredClient(
    api_key_auth="YOUR_API_KEY",
    # you may need to provide your unique API URL
    # server_url="YOUR_API_URL",
)

filename = "sample-docs/layout-parser-paper.pdf"
file = open(filename, "rb")

res = client.general.partition(request=operations.PartitionRequest(
    partition_parameters=shared.PartitionParameters(
        files=shared.Files(
            content=file.read(),
            file_name=filename,
        ),
        # Other parameters
        strategy=shared.Strategy.HI_RES,
        chunking_strategy=shared.ChunkingStrategy.BY_PAGE,
    ),
))

if res.elements is not None:
    # handle response
    pass
```


Legacy method without `PartitionRequest`:
```python
import unstructured_client
from unstructured_client.models import shared
from unstructured_client.models.errors import SDKError

client = unstructured_client.UnstructuredClient(
    api_key_auth="YOUR_API_KEY",
    # you may need to provide your unique API URL
    # server_url="YOUR_API_URL",
)

filename = "sample-docs/layout-parser-paper.pdf"
file = open(filename, "rb")

req = shared.PartitionParameters(
    # Note that this currently only supports a single file
    files=shared.Files(
        content=file.read(),
        file_name=filename,
    ),
    # Other parameters
    strategy="fast",
)

try:
    res = client.general.partition(req)
    print(res.elements[0])
except SDKError as e:
    print(e)
```

In the example above we're sending the request to the free Unstructured API, in which case the API URL is the same for all
users and you don't need to provide it. Note, however, that you still need to authenticate yourself with
your individual API Key.

If you want to use the SaaS Unstructured API, you need to define `server_url` as the unique API URL that you
received in the same email as your API key. For Unstructured API on Azure/AWS, use the API URL that you
configured through those services.

## Parameters & examples

The API parameters are the same across all methods of accessing the Unstructured API.

* Refer to the [API parameters](/api-reference/api-services/api-parameters) page for the full list of available parameters.
* Refer to the [Examples](/api-reference/api-services/examples) page for some inspiration on using the parameters.
