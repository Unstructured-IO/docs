           ![load balancer](/img/api/Azure_Step5.png)

        4. Click **Create**.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Finalize and deploy">
        1. Click **Review + create**.
        2. Wait for validation.
        3. Click **Create**.

           ![deployment](/img/api/Azure_Step6.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Post-deployment: additional load balancer configuration">
        1. Go to your load balancer: in the Azure portal's **Search resources, services and docs** box, enter and then select **Load balancers**.
        2. Search for and open the new load balancer that you created earlier, or the existing load balancer that you chose earlier.
        3. Make any necessary settings updates to your new or existing load balancer, based on the recommended configurations in the [Load balancer network settings](#load-balancer-network-settings) section, later on this page.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Post-deployment: get the deployed endpoint URL">
        1. Go to your virtual machine: in the Azure portal's **Search resources, services and docs** box, enter and then select **Virtual machines**.
        2. Search for and open the new virtual machine that you created earlier, using the name that you entered earlier.
        3. On the **Overview** tab, under **Properties**, note the **Public IP address** for the **Load balancer**.

           ![retrieve public ip](/img/api/Azure_Step7.png)

        4. The deployed endpoint URL is **http://\<load-balancer-public-IP-address>/general/v0/general**. Note this endpoint URL, as you will need it later to call the Unstructured API.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Post-deployment: set API environment variables">
        Note the API environment variables in the [API environment variables](#api-environment-variables) section, later on this page. If you need to set any of these in the Docker container on the virtual machine, do the following:
        
        1. If the virtual machine is not already running from earlier, click the **Start** icon.
        2. After the virtual machine starts, click the **Connect** icon, and then click **Connect** from the drop-down list.
        3. Follow the on-screen directions for one of the available options to connect to the virtual machine and display a connected terminal.
        5. Stop the running container in the virtual machine, so that you can restart it later with the environment variables set: In the connected terminal, run the following command: `sudo docker container ls`.
        6. Note the `CONTAINER ID` value for the running container.
        7. Run the following command, replacing `<CONTAINER ID>` with the `CONTAINER ID` value:

           ```bash
           sudo docker container rm --force <CONTAINER ID>
           ```

        8. Now run the container again, setting the environment variables at the same time: Run the following command: `sudo docker image ls`.
        9. Note the `REPOSITORY` and `TAG` value for the Docker image.
        10. Run the following command, replacing `<REPOSITORY>` and `<TAG>` with the `REPOSITORY` and `TAG` values for the Docker image, and replacing 
            `<VAR1>=<value1>`, `<VAR2>=<value2>` and so on with the environment variable name and value pairs:

            ```bash
            sudo docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \
            -p 80:5000 \
            -e <VAR1>=<value1> -e <VAR2>=<value2> -e <VAR3>=<value3> \
            <REPOSITORY>:<TAG>
            ```

        11. Verify that the environment variables were set correctly: Run the following command:

            ```bash
            sudo docker container ls
            ```

        12. Note the `CONTAINER ID` value for the running container.
        13. Run the following command, replacing `<CONTAINER ID>` with the `CONTAINER ID` value:

           ```bash
           sudo docker exec <CONTAINER ID> bash -c 'printenv'
           ```

        14. The environment variables should be in the list that appears.

        <Note>To help manage your overall costs, you should click the **Stop** icon whenever you are not using this virtual machine to call the Unstructured API.</Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Call the Unstructured API">
        You can now use the running virtual machine to call the Unstructured API. For example, run one of the following, setting the following environment variables to make your code more portable:

        - Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` to `http://`, followed by your load balancer's public IP address, followed by `/general/v0/general`.
        - Set `LOCAL_FILE_INPUT_DIR` to the path on your local machine to the files for the Unstructured API to process. If you do not have any input files available, you can download any of the ones from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in GitHub.
        - Set `LOCAL_FILE_OUTPUT_DIR` to the path on your local machine for Unstructured API to send the processed output in JSON format.
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>To help manage your overall costs, you should stop running the associated virtual machine whenever you are not using it to call the Unstructured API.</Note>

## Load balancer network settings

Unstructured recommends the following load balancer settings, which you should set on your deployment's load balancer soon after you finalize and deploy it.

On the load balancer's **Overview** tab in the Azure portal:

- **SKU**: **Standard**

On the load balancer's **Settings** tab in the Azure portal: 

- **Frontend IP configuration**: Private IP
- **Backend pools**: VMSS
- **Health probes**:

  - **Protocol**: **HTTP**, or **HTTPS** (this requires setting up a reverse proxy on the VMSS set to do TLS termination)
  - **Port**: `80` or `443` (this can be any port that the backend VMs are listening on)
  - **Path**: `/healthcheck`
  - **Interval (seconds)**: `5`

- **Load balancing rules**:

  - **Protocol**: **TCP**
  - **Port**: `443` for HTTPS, or `80` for HTTP
  - **Backend port**: `443` for HTTPS, or `80` for HTTP
  - **Idle timeout (minutes)**: `60`
  - **Enable TCP Reset** box: Checked

- **Inbound NAT rules**:

  - **Frontend Port**: `443` for HTTPS, or `80` for HTTP
  - **Backend port**: `443` for HTTPS, or `80` for HTTP
  - **Protocol**: **TCP**
  - **Enable TCP Reset** box: Checked
  - **Idle timeout (minutes)**: `60`

## API environment variables

Unstructured supports the following environment variables, which you can set in the Docker image on the virtual machine, as needed:

- `ALLOW_ORIGINS`: CORS-allowed origins.
- `UNSTRUCTURED_ALLOWED_MIMETYPE`: The list of allowed MIME types, if you want to limit the file types that can be processed.
- `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY`: The default Unstructured API key to use.
- `UNSTRUCTURED_MEMORY_FREE_MINIMUM_MB`: The minimum amount of free memory in MB to allow for processing a file. If this memory is too low, the server will return a `503` error.
- `UNSTRUCTURED_PDF_HI_RES_MAX_PAGES`: The maximum number of pages in a PDF file that the Unstructured API will not reject, if the `hi_res` strategy is used. The default is `300`.
- `UNSTRUCTURED_REDIRECT_ROOT_URL`: If this is set, redirect a `GET` request to the Unstructured API to use this URL instead.
