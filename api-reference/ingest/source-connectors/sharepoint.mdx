import NewDocument from '/snippets/general-shared-text/new-document.mdx';

<NewDocument />

import SharedContentSharePoint from '/snippets/sc-shared-text/sharepoint-cli-api.mdx';
import SharedAPIKeyURL from '/snippets/general-shared-text/api-key-url.mdx';

<SharedContentSharePoint/>
<SharedAPIKeyURL/>

Now call the Unstructured Ingest CLI or the Unstructured Ingest Python library. The destination connector can be any of the ones supported. This example uses the local destination connector:

import SharePointAPISh from '/snippets/source_connectors/sharepoint.sh.mdx';
import SharePointAPIPyV2 from '/snippets/source_connectors/sharepoint.v2.py.mdx';
import SharePointAPIPyV1 from '/snippets/source_connectors/sharepoint.v1.py.mdx';
