Make sure to set the `--partition-by-api` flag and pass in your API key with `--api-key`:

import LocalAPISh from '/snippets/source_connectors/local_api.sh.mdx';
import LocalAPIPy from '/snippets/source_connectors/local_api.py.mdx';

<CodeGroup>

  <LocalAPISh />

  <LocalAPIPy />

</CodeGroup>

Additionally, if you're using Unstructured Serverless API, your locally deployed Unstructured API, or an Unstructured API
deployed on Azure or AWS, you also need to specify the API URL via the `--partition-endpoint` argument.
