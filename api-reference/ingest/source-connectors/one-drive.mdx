Make sure to set the `--partition-by-api` flag and pass in your API key with `--api-key`:

import OneDriveAPISh from '/snippets/source_connectors/onedrive_api.sh.mdx';
import OneDriveAPIPy from '/snippets/source_connectors/onedrive_api.py.mdx';

<CodeGroup>

  <OneDriveAPISh />

  <OneDriveAPIPy />

</CodeGroup>

Additionally, if you're using Unstructured SaaS API, your locally deployed Unstructured API, or an Unstructured API
deployed on Azure or AWS, you also need to specify the API URL via the `--partition-endpoint` argument.
