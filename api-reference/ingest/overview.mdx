You can send multiple files in batches to be ingested by Unstructured API services for processing. 
_Ingestion_ is the term that Unstructured uses to refer to the set of activities that happens when files are input for processing. [Learn more](/ingestion/overview).

You can send batches to Unstructured API services by using the following tools:

- The [Unstructured Ingest CLI](/api-reference/ingest/ingest-cli)
- The [Unstructured Ingest Python](/api-reference/ingest/python-ingest) library

## Learn more

- [Ingest configuration](/api-reference/ingest/ingest-configuration/overview) settings enable you to control how batches are sent and processed.
- [Source connectors](/api-reference/ingest/source-connectors/overview) enable you to send batches from local or remote locations to be ingested by Unstructured API services for processing.
- [Destination connectors](/api-reference/ingest/destination-connector/overview) enable Unstructured API services to send the processed data to local or remote locations.
