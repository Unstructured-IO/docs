title: Generate a JSON schema for a file
---

## Task

You want to generate a schema for a JSON file that Unstructured produces, so that you can validate, test, 
and document related JSON files across your systems.  

## Approach

Use a Python package such as [genson](https://pypi.org/project/genson/) to generate schemas for your 
JSON files.

<Info>The `genson` package is not owned or supported by Unstructured. For questions and 
requests, see the [Issues](https://github.com/wolverdude/genson/issues) tab of the 
`genson` repository in GitHub.</Info>

## Generate a schema from the terminal

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install genson">
        Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install the [genson](https://pypi.org/project/genson/) package.

        ```bash
        pip install genson
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install jq">
        By default, `genson` generates the JSON schema as a single string without any line breaks or indented whitespace. 

        To pretty-print the schema that `genson` produces, install the [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) utility.

        <Info>The `jq` utility is not owned or supported by Unstructured. For questions and 
        requests, see the [Issues](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/issues) tab of the 
        `jq` repository in GitHub.</Info>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Generate the schema">
        1. Run the `genson` command, specifying the path to the input (source) JSON file, and the path to 
           the output (target) JSON schema file to be generated. Use `jq` to pretty-print the schema's content 
           into the file to be generated.

           ```bash
           genson "/path/to/input/file.json" | jq '.' > "/path/to/output/schema.json"
           ```
    
        2. You can find the generated JSON schema file in the output path that you specified.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Generate a schema from Python code

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install dependencies">
        In your Python project, install the [genson](https://pypi.org/project/genson/) package.

        ```bash
        pip install genson
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add and run the schema generation code">
        1. Set the following local environment variables:

           - Set `LOCAL_FILE_INPUT_PATH` to the local path to the input (source) JSON file.
           - Set `LOCAL_FILE_OUTPUT_PATH` to the local path to the output (target) JSON schema file to be generated.

        2. Add the following Python code file to your project:

           ```python
           import os, json
           from genson import SchemaBuilder

           def json_schema_from_file(
               input_file_path: str,
               output_schema_path: str
           ) -> None:
               try:
                   with open(input_file_path, "r") as file:
                       json_data = json.load(file)

                   builder = SchemaBuilder()
                   builder.add_object(json_data)

                   schema = builder.to_schema()

                   try:
                       with open(output_schema_path, "w") as schema_file:
                           json.dump(schema, schema_file, indent=2)
                   except IOError as e:
                       raise IOError(f"Error writing to output file: {e}")
                   
                   print(f"JSON schema successfully generated and saved to '{output_schema_path}'.")
               except FileNotFoundError:
                   print(f"Error: Input file '{input_file_path}' not found.")
               except IOError as e:
                   print(f"I/O error occurred: {e}")
               except Exception as e:
                   print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

           if __name__ == "__main__":
               json_schema_from_file(
                   input_file_path=os.getenv("LOCAL_FILE_INPUT_PATH"),
                   output_schema_path=os.getenv("LOCAL_FILE_OUTPUT_PATH")
               )
           ```

        3. Run the Python code file.
        4. Check the path specified by `LOCAL_FILE_OUTPUT_PATH` for the generated JSON schema file.
    </Step>
