sidebarTitle: POST request

To make POST requests to the [Unstructured Partition Endpoint](/api-reference/partition/overview), you will need:

import SharedAPIKeyURL from '/snippets/general-shared-text/api-key-url.mdx';

<SharedAPIKeyURL />

To get your API key, do the following:

import GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly from '/snippets/general-shared-text/get-started-simple-api-only.mdx';

<GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly/>

The API base URL is `https://api.unstructuredapp.io`

Let's start with a simple example in which you use [curl](https://curl.se/) to send a local PDF file (`*.pdf`) to partition via the Unstructured Partition Endpoint.

In this command, be sure to replace `<path/to/file>` with the path to your local PDF file.

```bash
curl --request 'POST' \
"$UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL/v1/partition_async" \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header "unstructured-api-key: $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY" \
--header 'content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
--form 'strategy=vlm' \
--form 'vlm_model_provider=openai' \
--form 'vlm_model=gpt-4o' \
--form 'output_format=application/json' \
--form 'files=@<path/to/file>;type=application/pdf'
```

In the example above we're representing the base API endpoint with the environment variable `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL`. Note, however, that you also need to authenticate yourself with
your individual API Key, represented by the environment variable `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY`. Learn how to obtain an API URL and API key in the [Unstructured Partition Endpoint guide](/api-reference/partition/overview).

The results are printed to your terminal or Command Prompt with a format similar to the following:

```json
{
   "partition_id": "<job-id>",
   "partition_status": "scheduled",
   "partition_status_message": "Partition job created"
}
```

Make a note of the `<job-id>` value.

Next, run the following `curl` command, replacing `<job_id>` with the `<job_id>` value:

```bash
curl --request 'GET' \
"$UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL/v1/partition_async/<job_id>" \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header "unstructured-api-key: $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"
```

The results are printed to your terminal or Command Prompt with a format similar to the following:

```json
{
   "partition_id": "<job-id>",
   "partition_status": "in_progress",
   "partition_status_message": "Started processing partition request",
   "elements": null
}
```

If the job is still in progress, repeat the `curl` command until the job is complete. However, if you run the `curl` command 
and the job has successfully completed, the results that are printed to your terminal or Command Prompt will contain the processed data within the 
`elements` array, for example:

```json
{
    "partition_id": "<job-id>",
    "partition_status": "completed",
    "partition_status_message": "Partition job completed",
    "elements": [
        {
            "type": "...",
            "element_id": "...",
            "text": "...",
            "metadata": {
                "...": "..."
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "...",
            "element_id": "...",
            "text": "...",
            "metadata": {
                "...": "..."
            }
        }
    ]   
}
```

By default, the JSON is printed without indenting or other whitespace. You can pretty-print the JSON output by using utilities such as [jq](https://jqlang.org/tutorial/) in future command runs. 

You can also pipe the JSON output to a local file by using the `curl` option [-o, --output \<file\>](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-o) in future command runs.

## Synchronous requests

The preceding section describes how to make _asynchronous_ requests to the Unstructured Partition Endpoint. 
The Unstructured Partition Endpoint also supports _synchronous_ requests. 

To make a synchronous request, replace `/v1/partition_async` with `/general/v0/general` as follows:

```bash
curl --request 'POST' \
"$UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL/general/v0/general" \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header "unstructured-api-key: $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY" \
--header 'content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
--form 'strategy=fast' \
--form 'output_format=application/json' \
--form 'files=@<path/to/file>;type=text/plain'
```

If the request is successfully completed, the processed data is returned directly to your terminal or Command Prompt, without needing to make any 
additional requests. However, you must wait for the request to complete and return the results. 

While supported, synchronous requests are not recommended for the following reasons: 

- A synchronous request must wait until the operation is complete, which might result in a timeout error.
- A waiting synchronous request is a poor user experience, as it can give the user the mistaken impression that nothing is happening.
- While waiting, you cannot poll to check the current status of a synchronous request.
- If the related network connection is lost during a synchronous request, the request might fail.

For these reasons, if you must make synchronous requests, they should be limited to processing only relatively small, text-based files.

## Parameters & examples

The API parameters are the same across all methods of accessing the Unstructured Partition Endpoint.

* Refer to the [API parameters](/api-reference/partition/api-parameters) page for the full list of available parameters.
* Refer to the [Examples](/api-reference/partition/examples) page for some inspiration on using the parameters.

## Postman collection

Unstructured offers a [Postman collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collections/collections-overview/) that you can import into Postman to make POST requests through a graphical user interface.

1. [Install Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/).
2. [Sign in to Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation/postman-account/#signing-in-to-postman).
3. In your workspace, click **Import**.
