To make POST requests to the Unstructured Partition Endpoint, you will need:

import SharedAPIKeyURL from '/snippets/general-shared-text/api-key-url.mdx';

<SharedAPIKeyURL />

[Get your API key](/api-reference/partition/overview).

The API URL is `https://api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general`

Let's start with a simple example in which you use [curl](https://curl.se/) to send a local PDF file (`*.pdf`) to partition via the Unstructured Partition Endpoint.

In this command, be sure to replace `<path/to/file>` with the path to your local PDF file.

```bash
curl --request 'POST' \
"$UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL" \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header "unstructured-api-key: $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY" \
--header 'content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
--form 'content_type=string' \
--form 'strategy=vlm' \
--form 'vlm_model_provider=openai' \
--form 'vlm_model=gpt-4o' \
--form 'output_format=application/json' \
--form 'files=@<path/to/file>;type=application/pdf'
```

In the example above we're representing the API endpoint with the environment variable `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL`. Note, however, that you also need to authenticate yourself with
your individual API Key, represented by the environment variable `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY`. Learn how to obtain an API URL and API key in the [Unstructured Partition Endpoint guide](/api-reference/partition/overview).

## Parameters & examples

The API parameters are the same across all methods of accessing the Unstructured Partition Endpoint.

* Refer to the [API parameters](/api-reference/partition/api-parameters) page for the full list of available parameters.
* Refer to the [Examples](/api-reference/partition/examples) page for some inspiration on using the parameters.
