title: Extract tables as HTML
---

## Task

You want to get, save, or show the contents of elements that are represented as HTML, such as tables that are embedded in a PDF document.

## Approach

Extract the contents of an element's `text_as_html` JSON object, which is nested inside of its parent `metadata` object.

## To run this example

You will need a document that is one of the document types that can output the `text_as_html` JSON object. For the list of applicable document types, see the entries in the table at the beginning of [Partitioning](/open-source/core-functionality/partitioning) where "Table Support" is "Yes."

This example uses a PDF file with an embedded table.

import SharedAPIKeyURL from '/snippets/general-shared-text/api-key-url.mdx';
import ExtractTextAsHTMLPy from '/snippets/how-to-api/extract_text_as_html.py.mdx';

## Code

For the [Unstructured Python SDK](/api-reference/partition/sdk-python), you'll need:
<SharedAPIKeyURL />
<ExtractTextAsHTMLPy />
