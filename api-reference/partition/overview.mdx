title: Overview
---

The Unstructured Partition Endpoint, part of the [Unstructured API](/api-reference/overview), is intended for rapid prototyping of Unstructured's 
various partitioning strategies, with limited support for chunking. It is designed to work only with processing of local files, one file 
at a time. Use the [Unstructured Workflow Endpoint](/api-reference/workflow/overview) for production-level scenarios, file processing in 
large batches, files and data in remote locations, generating embeddings, applying post-transform enrichments, using the latest and 
highest-performing models, and for the highest quality results at the lowest cost.

## Get started

To call the Unstructured Partition Endpoint, you need an Unstructured account and an Unstructured API key:

import GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly from '/snippets/general-shared-text/get-started-simple-api-only.mdx';

<GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly/>

## Set up billing

<Note>
    If you initially signed up for a subscribe-and-save plan instead, of if you signed up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead, your billing setup and terms will 
    be different. For billing guidance, contact Unstructured Sales at [sales@unstructured.io](mailto:sales@unstructured.io).
</Note>

You must set up your billing information to keep using the Unstructured Partition Endpoint:

![Unstructured account settings](/img/ui/AccountSettings.png)

![Unstructured account payment method](/img/ui/AccountBillingPaymentMethod.png)

1. Sign in to your Unstructured account, at [https://platform.unstructured.io](https://platform.unstructured.io).
2. At the bottom of the sidebar, click your user icon, and then click **Account Settings**.
3. Click the **Billing** tab.
4. Click **Manage Payment Method**, follow the on-screen instructions to enter or update your payment details, and then click **Save card**.

Your card is billed monthly based on your usage. The **Billing** page shows a billing overview for the current month and a list of your billing invoices.

<Tip>
    You can save money by switching from a pay-per-page plan to a subscribe-and-save plan. To do this, 
    go to the [Unstructured Subscribe & Save](https://unstructured.io/subscribeandsave) page and complete the on-screen instructions.

## Quickstart

This example uses the [curl](https://curl.se/) utility on your local machine to call the Unstructured Partition Endpoint. It sends one or more source (input) files from your local machine to the Unstructured Partition Endpoint which then delivers the processed data to a destination (output) location, also on your local machine. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

If you do not have source files readily available, you could use for example a sample PDF file containing the text of the United States Constitution, 
available for download from [https://constitutioncenter.org/media/files/constitution.pdf](https://constitutioncenter.org/media/files/constitution.pdf).

<Steps>
    <Step title="Set environment variables">
        From your terminal or Command Prompt, set the following two environment variables. 
        
        - Replace `<your-unstructured-api-url>` with the Unstructured Partition Endpoint base URL, which is `https://api.unstructuredapp.io`
        - Replace `<your-unstructured-api-key>` with your Unstructured API key, which you generated earlier on this page.

        ```bash
        export UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL=<your-unstructured-api-url>
        export UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY="<your-unstructured-api-key>"
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a partition job">
        Run the following `curl` command, replacing `<path/to/file-1>` with the path to the source file on your local machine. To specify 
        multiple files, repeat the `--form 'files=@<path/to/file-N>;type=application/pdf'` option in this command for each additional file.

        If the source file is not a PDF file, then remove `;type=application/pdf` from the related `--form` option in this command.

        ```bash
        curl --request 'POST' \
        "$UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL/v1/partition_async" \
        --header 'accept: application/json' \
        --header "unstructured-api-key: $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY" \
        --header 'content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
        --form 'strategy=vlm' \
        --form 'vlm_model_provider=openai' \
        --form 'vlm_model=gpt-4o' \
        --form 'output_format=application/json' \
        --form 'files=@<path/to/file-1>;type=application/pdf' \
        --form 'files=@<path/to/file-N>;type=application/pdf'
        ```

        The results are printed to your terminal or Command Prompt with a format similar to the following:

        ```json
        {
            "partition_id": "<job-id>",
            "partition_status": "scheduled",
            "partition_status_message": "Partition job created"
        }
        ```

        Make a note of the `<job-id>` value, as you will need it in the next step.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Check the status of the job">
        Run the following `curl` command, replacing `<job_id>` with the `<job_id>` value from the previous step.

        ```bash
        curl --request 'GET' \
        "$UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL/v1/partition_async/<job_id>" \
        --header 'accept: application/json' \
        --header "unstructured-api-key: $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"
        ```

        The results are printed to your terminal or Command Prompt with a format similar to the following:

        ```json
        {
            "partition_id": "<job-id>",
            "partition_status": "in_progress",
            "partition_status_message": "Started processing partition request",
            "elements": null
        }
        ```

        If the job is still in progress, repeat the `curl` command until the job is complete.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Examine the results">
        If you run the preceding command and the job has successfully completed, the results that are printed to your terminal or Command Prompt will contain the processed data within the 
        `elements` array, for example:

        ```json
        {
            "partition_id": "<job-id>",
            "partition_status": "in_progress",
            "partition_status_message": "Started processing partition request",
            "elements": [
                {
                    "type": "...",
                    "element_id": "...",
                    "text": "...",
                    "metadata": {
                        "...": "..."
                    }
                },
                {
                    "type": "...",
                    "element_id": "...",
                    "text": "...",
                    "metadata": {
                        "...": "..."
                    }
                }
            ]   
        }
        ```

        By default, the JSON is printed without indenting or other whitespace. You can pretty-print the JSON output by using utilities such as [jq](https://jqlang.org/tutorial/) in future command runs. 
        
        You can also pipe the JSON output to a local file by using the `curl` option [-o, --output \<file\>](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-o) in future command runs.
    </Step>

You can also call the Unstructured Partition Endpoint by using the [Unstructured Python SDK](/api-reference/partition/sdk-python) or the [Unstructured JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](/api-reference/partition/sdk-jsts).
