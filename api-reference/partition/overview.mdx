title: Overview
---

The Unstructured Partition Endpoint, part of the [Unstructured API](/api-reference/overview), is intended for rapid prototyping of Unstructured's 
various partitioning strategies, with limited support for chunking. It is designed to work only with processing of local files, one file 
at a time. Use the [Unstructured Workflow Endpoint](/api-reference/workflow/overview) for production-level scenarios, file processing in 
batches, files and data in remote locations, generating embeddings, applying post-transform enrichments, using the latest and 
highest-performing models, and for the highest quality results at the lowest cost.

## Get started

To call the Unstructured Partition Endpoint, you need an Unstructured account and an Unstructured API key:

import GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly from '/snippets/general-shared-text/get-started-simple-api-only.mdx';

<GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly/>

[Try the quickstart](#quickstart).

## Quickstart

<Tip>
    To use the Unstructured Python SDK instead of `curl` for the following quickstart, 
    [skip ahead](/api-reference/partition/quickstart) to the SDK version instead.
</Tip>

This example uses the [curl](https://curl.se/) utility on your local machine to call the Unstructured Partition Endpoint. It sends a source (input) file from your local machine to the Unstructured Partition Endpoint which then delivers the processed data to a destination (output) location, also on your local machine. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.

If you do not have a source file readily available, you could use for example a sample PDF file containing the text of the United States Constitution, 
available for download from [https://constitutioncenter.org/media/files/constitution.pdf](https://constitutioncenter.org/media/files/constitution.pdf).

<Steps>
    <Step title="Set environment variables">
        From your terminal or Command Prompt, set the following two environment variables. 
        
        - Replace `<your-unstructured-api-url>` with the Unstructured Partition Endpoint URL. This URL was provided to you when your Unstructured account was created. 
          If you do not have this URL, email Unstructured Support at [support@unstructured.io](mailto:support@unstructured.io).

          <Note>
              The default URL for the Unstructured Partition Endpoint is `https://api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general`. 
              However, you should always use the URL that was provided to you when your Unstructured account was created.
          </Note>
          
        - Replace `<your-unstructured-api-key>` with your Unstructured API key, which you generated earlier on this page.

        ```bash
        export UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL=<your-unstructured-api-url>
        export UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY="<your-unstructured-api-key>"
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the curl command">
        Run the following `curl` command, replacing `<path/to/file>` with the path to the source file on your local machine.

        If the source file is not a PDF file, then remove `;type=application/pdf` from the final `--form` option in this command.

        ```bash
        curl --request 'POST' \
        "$UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL" \
        --header 'accept: application/json' \
        --header "unstructured-api-key: $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY" \
        --header 'content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
        --form 'content_type=string' \
        --form 'strategy=vlm' \
        --form 'vlm_model_provider=openai' \
        --form 'vlm_model=gpt-4o' \
        --form 'output_format=application/json' \
        --form 'files=@<path/to/file>;type=application/pdf'
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Examine the results">
        After you run the `curl` command, the results are printed to your terminal or Command Prompt. The command might take several 
        minutes to complete.

        By default, the JSON is printed without indenting or other whitespace. You can pretty-print the JSON output by using utilities such as [jq](https://jqlang.org/tutorial/) in future command runs. 
        
        You can also pipe the JSON output to a local file by using the `curl` option [-o, --output \<file\>](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-o) in future command runs.
    </Step>

You can also call the Unstructured Partition Endpoint by using the [Unstructured Python SDK](/api-reference/partition/sdk-python) or the [Unstructured JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](/api-reference/partition/sdk-jsts).
