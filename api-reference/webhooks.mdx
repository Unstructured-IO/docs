title: Webhooks

A _webhook_ is a way for a _sender_ (also sometimes called a _source_, _provider_, _producer_, or _sender 
application_) to send data to a _receiver_ (also sometimes called a _destination_, _consumer_, 
_receiver application_, or simply an _endpoint_). For Unstructured webhooks, Unstructured is the sender, 
and your solution is the receiver. Some popular receivers include 
[AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/urls-webhook-tutorial.html), 
[Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook), 
[Google Cloud Run](https://docs.cloud.google.com/run/docs/triggering/webhooks), 
[Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/what-are-webhooks/), 
[Slack](https://docs.slack.dev/messaging/sending-messages-using-incoming-webhooks/), 
[Svix](https://svix.com), and 
[Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/).

The receiver provides a unique URL (often called the 
_webhook URL_, _callback URL_, or _notification URL_), to receive the data from Unstructured. 
Unstructured calls the webhook URL by using an HTTP POST operation and 
passes a payload of data to the receiver in JSON format. The receiver then processes the payload and can decide 
what to do with the data from there.

Because webhooks are event-driven, something must first happen to trigger the webhook. In 
Unstructured, these webhooks can be triggered whenever a [job](/api-reference/workflow/jobs) that is associated with its target [workflow](/api-reference/workflow/workflows) does 
one or more of the following:

- Is scheduled (programmatically, an event type of `job.scheduled`)
- Begins its work (`job.in_progress`)
- Has stopped (`job.stopped`)
- Fails (`job.failed`)
- Is completed (`job.completed`) 

When a webhook is configured to deliver event-driven notification data payloads from a sender to a receiver, this configuration 
is called a _notification channel_. For Unstructured webhooks, notification channels can be created and managed at the following levels:

- At the account level, known as an _account-scoped notification channel_. This allows any job that is associated with any 
  workflow in the account to trigger the webhook. This can be useful for example for routing pager requests to a team of on-call engineers in an 
  IT operations center whenever any job fails across the organization.
- At the workflow level, known as _workflow-scoped notification channels_. This allows any job that is associated only with 
  the target workflow to trigger the webhook. This can be useful for example for emailing a department's data analyst that a long-running job for a specific workflow 
  has now completed, allowing them to begin working with the latest output. 

Whenever a webhook is triggered, the act of Unstructured sending the notification data payload is called a 
_notification_. You can get a count or a list of these notifications. You can also mark them in your Unstructured account as read after 
you have processed them according to your organization's needs. Marking a notification as read can help you keep track of 
which notifications you have already dealt with and which ones you still need to take action on.

## Requirements

To create, view, and manage webhooks, Unstructured provides a set of Representational State Transfer (REST) endpoints. You can 
call these endpoints through standard REST-enabled utilities, tools, programming languages, packages, and libraries. 
The examples, shown later on this page, describe how to call the Unstructured API's webhook operations with 
`curl` and Postman. You can adapt this information as needed for your preferred programming languages and libraries, 
for example by using the `requests` library with Python.

To call the Unstructured API's webhook operations, you must have an Unstructured API URL and a valid Unstructured API key.

To get your Unstructured API URL, do the following:

import GetStartedAPIURLOnly from '/snippets/general-shared-text/get-started-api-url-only.mdx';

<GetStartedAPIURLOnly/>

To get your Unstructured API key, do the following:

import GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly from '/snippets/general-shared-text/get-started-simple-api-only.mdx';

<GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly/>

In the following examples, the API URL and API key are represented by the following placeholders, respectively:

- `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL`
- `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY`

To learn how to set these placeholders as variables, see the `curl` or Postman documentation.

## Create an account-scoped notification channel

To create a webhook that is trigged for all corresponding events across your Unstructured account, 
call the `POST /notifications/channels` operation.

In the following examples, replace the following placeholders:

- Replace `<webhook-url>` with your receiver's webhook URL.
- Replace `<event-type>` with the programmatic name of the event that you want to trigger the webhook. To allow this 
  webhook to be triggered in succession for multiple events, add multiple `<event-type>` entries. For the list of 
  available event types, see this article's introductory section.
- Replace `<description>` with some meaningful description of the webhook, for your own reference.

        4. On the **Body** tab, select **raw** and **JSON**, and specify the settings for the notification channel:

            ```json
            {
                "channel_type": "webhook",
