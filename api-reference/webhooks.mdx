title: Webhooks
---

A _webhook_ is a common technique that allows a _sender_ to automatically send data to a _receiver_ based on events that happen in the sender. For Unstructured webhooks, Unstructured is the sender, 
and your solution is the receiver. Some popular receivers include 
[AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/urls-webhook-tutorial.html), 
[Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook), 
[Google Cloud Run](https://docs.cloud.google.com/run/docs/triggering/webhooks), 
[Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/what-are-webhooks/), 
[Slack](https://docs.slack.dev/messaging/sending-messages-using-incoming-webhooks/), 
[Svix](https://svix.com), and 
[Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/).

The receiver provides a unique URL, called the 
_webhook URL_, to receive the data that Unstructured sends. 
Behind the scenes, when specific events happen in Unstructured, Unstructured then automatically calls the webhook URL by using an HTTP POST operation and 
passes payloads of data in JSON format related to those events to the receiver. The receiver then processes the payload and can decide 
what to do with the data from there.

Because webhooks are event-driven, some event must first be triggered to begin generating the related data to be sent. In 
Unstructured, these webhooks can be triggered whenever a [job](/api-reference/workflow/jobs) that is associated with its target [workflow](/api-reference/workflow/workflows) does 
one or more of the following:

- Is scheduled to start running later (programmatically, an event type of `job.scheduled`)
- Has begun running (`job.in_progress`)
- Has stopped running (`job.stopped`)
- Has failed to successfully complete (`job.failed`)
- Has successfully completed (`job.completed`) 

When a webhook is configured to deliver event-driven notification data payloads from a sender to a receiver, this configuration 
is called a _notification channel_. For Unstructured webhooks, notification channels can be created and managed at the following levels:

- At the **workspace** level, known as a _workspace-scoped notification channel_. This allows any job that is associated with a 
  workspace in an Unstructured account to trigger the webhook. This can be useful for example for routing pager requests to a team of on-call engineers in an 
  IT operations center whenever any job fails across the workspace.

  <Note>
    Each **Let's Go** or **Pay-As-You-Go** account has one and only one workspace.

    An Unstructured **Business** account can have multiple workspaces.
  </Note>

- At the **workflow** level, known as a _workflow-scoped notification channel_. This allows any job that is associated only with 
  the target workflow in an Unstructured account to trigger the webhook. This can be useful for example for emailing a department's data analyst that a long-running job for a specific workflow 
  has now completed, allowing them to begin working with the latest output. 

Whenever a webhook is triggered, the act of Unstructured sending the event data payload is called a 
_notification_. You can get a count or a list of these notifications. You can also mark them in your Unstructured account as read after 
you have processed them according to your organization's needs. Marking a notification as read can help you keep track of 
which notifications you have already dealt with and which ones you still need to take action on.

This article describes how to create, view, and manage webhooks and notifications at both the workspace and workflow levels by using the Unstructured API. 

<Info>
  The Unstructured user interface (UI) allows limited creation, viewing, and managing of webhooks only, as follows ([learn how](/ui/webhooks)):

  - Webhooks for a personal Unstructured workspace. Each personal Unstructured account has one and only one personal Unstructured workspace.
  - Webhooks for a workspace within an Unstructured **Business** account.

  You cannot use the Unstructured UI to create, view, or manage notifications or workflow-level webhooks.
</Info>

## Requirements

To create, view, and manage webhooks, Unstructured provides a set of Representational State Transfer (REST) endpoints. You can 
call these endpoints through standard REST-enabled utilities, tools, programming languages, packages, and libraries. 
The examples, shown later on this page, describe how to call the Unstructured API's webhook operations with 
`curl` and Postman. You can adapt this information as needed for your preferred programming languages and libraries, 
for example by using the `requests` library with Python.

To call the Unstructured API's webhook operations, you must have an Unstructured API URL and a valid Unstructured API key.

To get your Unstructured API URL, do the following:

import GetStartedAPIURLOnly from '/snippets/general-shared-text/get-started-api-url-only.mdx';

<GetStartedAPIURLOnly/>

To get your Unstructured API key, do the following:

import GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly from '/snippets/general-shared-text/get-started-simple-api-only.mdx';

<GetStartedSimpleAPIOnly/>

In the following examples, the API URL and API key are represented by the following placeholders, respectively:

- `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL`
- `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY`

<Tip>
  Each Unstructured API key works with one and only one workspace (and the workflows within that workspace). Make sure you are using the right API key 
  for your target workspace!
</Tip>

To learn how to set these placeholders as variables, see the `curl` or Postman documentation.

## Create a workspace-scoped notification channel

To create a notification channel that is used for all corresponding events across a workspace, 
call the `POST /notifications/channels` operation.

In the following examples, replace the following placeholders:

- Replace `<webhook-url>` with your receiver's webhook URL.
- Replace `<event-type>` with the programmatic name of the event that you want to trigger. To allow multiple 
  events to be triggered, add multiple `<event-type>` entries. For the list of 
  available event types, see this article's introductory section.
- Replace `<description>` with some meaningful description of the notification channel, for your own reference.

## Get a notification

To get information about a notification for a workspace, 
call the `GET /notifications/<notification-id>` operation.

In the following examples, replace `<notification-id>` with the notification's unique ID. 
To get this ID, see [List all notifications for a workspace](#list-all-notifications-for-a-workspace).

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="curl">
        ```bash
        curl --request 'GET' --location \
        "$UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL/notifications/<notification-id>" \

## Mark notifications as read

To mark any number of notifications as read, 
call the `GET /notifications/mark-read` operation.

In the following examples, replace the following placeholders:

- Replace `<webhook-url>` with your receiver's webhook URL.
- Replace `<notification-id>` with the unique ID of the notification that you want to mark as read. To allow multiple 
  notifications to be marked as read, add multiple `<notification-id>` entries. To get these IDs, see [List all notifications for a workspace](#list-all-notifications-for-a-workspace).
- Replace `<before>` to mark all notifications sent before the specified timestamp as read. The value must be a valid ISO 8601 timestamp in the 
  format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`, for example `2024-09-19T15:45:30Z`.
- For `mark_all`, set to `true` to mark all notifications as read.
- Replace `<workflow-id>` with the unique ID of the workflow that the notification is associated with.
  To get this ID, see [List workflows](/api-reference/workflow/overview#list-workflows).
- Only one of the following can be specified: `notification_ids`, `before`, or `mark_all`.
- If you specify `workflow_id`, you must also specify `before` or `mark_all`.

This results in the following behaviors:

- If you specify `notification_ids` only, it will mark all notifications with the specified IDs as read.
- If you specify `before` only, it will mark all notifications created in the workspace before the specified timestamp as read.
- If you specify `mark_all` only, it will mark at the time of the API call all existing notifications in the workspace as read.
- If you specify `workflow_id` and `before`, it will mark all notifications created before the specified timestamp for the specified workflow as read.
- If you specify `workflow_id` and `mark_all`, it will mark at the time of the API call all existing notifications associated with the specified workflow as read.
