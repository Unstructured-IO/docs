title: Unstructured API Quickstart - On-Demand Jobs
sidebarTitle: Quickstart
---

This quickstart shows how to use the [Unstructured Python SDK](/api-reference/workflow/overview#unstructured-python-sdk) 
to have Unstructured process local files by using its _on-demand jobs_ functionality, which is part of the 
Unstructured API's collection of [workflow operations](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/workflow/overview).

On-demand jobs take one or more local files as input and ouput the files' contents in Unstructured's 
[document elements and metadata]() format. This format is ideal for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), agentic AI, and model fine-tuning.

<Note>
    The on-demand jobs functionality is designed to work *only by processing local files*.

    To process files (and data) in remote file and blob storage, databases, and vector stores, you must use other 
    workflow operations in the Unstructured API. To learn how, see for example the notebook 
    [Dropbox-To-Pinecone Connector API Quickstart for Unstructured](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Unstructured-IO/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/Dropbox_To_Pinecone_Connector_Quickstart.ipynb).

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need:

- An Unstructured account. To sign up for an account, go to https://unstructured.io/?modal=try-for-free. 
  After you sign up, you are immediately signed in to your new **Let's Go**account, at https://platform.unstructured.io.
- An Unstructured API key, as follows:

  1. After you are signed in to your account, on the sidebar click **API Keys**.
  2. Click **Generate New Key**.
  3. Enter some meaningful display name for the key, and then click **Continue**.
  4. Next to the new key's name, click the **Copy** icon. The key's value is copied to your system's clipboard. 
     If you lose this key, simply return to the list and click **Copy** again.

- Python 3.9 or higher installed on your local machine.
- A Python virtual environment is recommended for isolating and versioning Python project code dependencies, 
  but this is not required. This quickstart uses the popular Python package and project manager [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) 
  for managing virtual environments. Installation and use of `uv` are described in the following steps.
- One or more local files for Unstructured to process. The following code example assumes that the local files 
  you want to process are in a folder named `input`, which is in the same project directory as the code. The files' types must be 
  in the list of [supported file types](/api-reference/supported-file-types).
- A destination folder for Unstructured to send its processed results to. The following code example assumes that the 
  destination folder a folder named `output`, which is in the same project directory as the code.

## Step 1: Create a Python virtual environment

In this step, you use `uv` to create a new Python project, and a virtual environment within this project, for this quickstart.

1. [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation) on your local machine, if it is not already installed.
2. Create a new, blank folder on your local machine for this quickstart, and then switch to this new folder. 
   This example creates a folder named `unstructured_api_quickstart` within your current working directory 
   and then switches to this new folder:

    ```bash
    mkdir unstructured_api_quickstart
    cd unstructured_api_quickstart
    ```

3. Create a new `uv` project for this quickstart by running the following command from within the new folder:

    ```bash
    uv init
    ```

4. Create a new virtual environment within this project by running the following command:

   ```bash
   uv venv
   ```

5. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

6. Install the Unstructured Python SDK into the virtual environment, by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   uv add unstructured-client
   ```

## Step 2: Add the example code

1. In the same directory as the project's `main.py` code file, add two folders named `input` and `output`. 
   Your project directory should now look like this:

   ```text
   unstructured_api_quickstart/
     ├── .venv/
     ├── input/  <- Upload your input files here.
     ├── output/ <- Unstructured will download its output files here.
     ├── .gitignore
     ├── .python-version
     ├── main.py
     ├── pyproject.toml
     ├── README.md
     └── uv.lock
   ```

2. Upload the files you want Unstructured to process into the new `input` folder.
3. Overwrite the contents of the `main.py` file with the following code. In this code, replace `<unstructured-api-key>` 
   with the value of your Unstructured API key.

   ```python
   # ...
   ```

## Step 3: Run the code and view the results

1. Run the code in the `main.py` file, by running the following command:

   ```bash
   uv run main.py
   ```

2. After the code finishes running, look in the `output` folder to see Unstructured's results.

## Next steps

This quickstart showed you how to use the Unstructured Python SDK to process local files by using Unstructured's _on-demand jobs_ functionality.

To learn more about how to use Unstructured to process local files, see the notebook 
[], running remotly in Google Colab. This notebook requires no local setup.
