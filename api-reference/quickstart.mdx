title: Unstructured API Quickstart - On-Demand Jobs
sidebarTitle: Quickstart
---

<Tip>
    This quickstart requires you to install the Unstructured Python SDK on your local machine. If you cannot or do not want to install 
    or run anything on your local machine, you can skip over to the notebook [Unstructured API On-Demand JobsQuickstart](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Unstructured-IO/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/Unstructured_API_On_Demand_Jobs_Quickstart.ipynb) instead. 
    The notebook is remotely hosted on Google Colab and requires no local machine setup steps.
</Tip>

This quickstart shows how to use the [Unstructured Python SDK](/api-reference/workflow/overview#unstructured-python-sdk) 
to have Unstructured process local files by using the Unstructured API's _on-demand jobs_ functionality. This functionality 
is part of the Unstructured API's collection of [workflow operations](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/workflow/overview).

On-demand jobs take one or more local files as input. Unstructured outputs the local files' contents as a series of Unstructured 
[document elements and metadata](/ui/document-elements). This format is ideal for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), 
agentic AI, and model fine-tuning.

<Note>
    The on-demand jobs functionality is designed to work *only by processing local files*.

    To process files (and data) in remote file and blob storage, databases, and vector stores, you must use other 
    workflow operations in the Unstructured API. To learn how, see for example the notebook 
    [Dropbox-To-Pinecone Connector API Quickstart for Unstructured](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Unstructured-IO/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/Dropbox_To_Pinecone_Connector_Quickstart.ipynb).  
</Note>

## Requirements

To run this quickstart, you will need:

- An Unstructured account. To sign up for an account, go to https://unstructured.io/?modal=try-for-free. 
  After you sign up, you are immediately signed in to your new **Let's Go** account, at https://platform.unstructured.io.
- An Unstructured API key, as follows:

  1. After you are signed in to your account, on the sidebar click **API Keys**.
  2. Click **Generate New Key**.
  3. Enter some meaningful display name for the key, and then click **Continue**.
  4. Next to the new key's name, click the **Copy** icon. The key's value is copied to your system's clipboard. 
     If you lose this key, simply return to the list and click **Copy** again.

- Python 3.9 or higher installed on your local machine.
- A Python virtual environment is recommended for isolating and versioning Python project code dependencies on your local machine, 
  but this is not required. This quickstart uses the popular Python package and project manager [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) 
  for managing virtual environments. Installation and use of `uv` are described in the following steps.
- One or more local files for Unstructured to process. The following code example assumes that the local files 
  you want to process are in a folder named `input`, which is in the same project directory as your Python code. Creation of this 
  folder is described in the following steps. The files' types must be 
  in the list of [supported file types](/api-reference/supported-file-types).

  <Note>
      Each on-demand job is limited to 10 files, and each file is limited to 10 MB in size.
  </Note>

- A destination folder for Unstructured to send its processed results to. The following code example assumes that the 
  destination folder is named `output` and is in the same project directory as your Python code. Creation of this 
  folder is described in the following steps.

## Step 1: Create a Python virtual environment

In this step, you use `uv` to create a new Python project, and a virtual environment within this project, for this quickstart.

<Note>
    If you do not want to use `uv` or create a Python project, you can do the following instead:
    
    1. Install the Unstructured Python SDK globally on your local machine by running the following command:
    
       ```bash
       pip install unstructured-client
       ```
       
    2. Skip ahead to [Step 2](#step-2%3A-add-the-example-code).
</Note>

1. [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation) on your local machine, if it is not already installed.
2. Create a new, blank folder on your local machine for this quickstart, and then switch to this new folder. 
   This example creates a folder named `unstructured_api_quickstart` within your current working directory 
   and then switches to this new folder:

    ```bash
    mkdir unstructured_api_quickstart
    cd unstructured_api_quickstart
    ```

3. Create a new `uv` project for this quickstart by running the following command from within the new folder:

    ```bash
    uv init
    ```

4. Create a new virtual environment within this project by running the following command:

   ```bash
   uv venv
   ```

5. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

6. Install the Unstructured Python SDK into the virtual environment, by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   uv add unstructured-client
   ```

## Step 2: Add the example code

import OnDemandJobsPythonCodeExample from '/snippets/how-to-api/on_demand_jobs_python_code_example.py.mdx';

1. In the same directory as the project's `main.py` code file, add two folders named `input` and `output`. 
   Your project directory should now look like this:

   ```text
   unstructured_api_quickstart/
     ├── .venv/
     ├── input/  <- Upload your input files here.
     ├── output/ <- Unstructured will download its output files here.
     ├── .gitignore
     ├── .python-version
     ├── main.py <- Your Python code will go here.
     ├── pyproject.toml
     ├── README.md
     └── uv.lock
   ```

   <Note>
       If you do not want to use `uv` or create a Python project, just create a blank file named `main.py` and two folders 
       named `input` and `output` that are all in the same local directory instead, for example:

       ```text
       <parent-directory>/
         ├── input/  <- Upload your input files here.
         ├── output/ <- Unstructured will download its output files here.
         └── main.py <- Your Python code will go here.
       ```
   </Note>
   
2. Upload the files you want Unstructured to process into the new `input` folder.
3. Overwrite the contents of the `main.py` file with the following code. In this code, replace `<your-unstructured-api-key>` 
   (in the `main()` function, near the end of the following code) with the value of your Unstructured API key. Then save this file.

   <OnDemandJobsPythonCodeExample />

## Step 3: Run the code and view the results

<Note>
    Each on-demand job is limited to 10 files, and each file is limited to 10 MB in size.
</Note>

1. Run the code in the `main.py` file, by running the following command:

   ```bash
   uv run main.py
   ```

   <Note>
       If you do not want to use `uv` or create a Python project, you can run the code by running the following command instead:

       ```bash
       python main.py
       ```
   </Note>

2. After the code finishes running, look in the `output` folder to see Unstructured's results.
