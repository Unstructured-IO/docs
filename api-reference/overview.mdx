The Unstructured API provides a set of programmatic operations that enable you to have Unstructured:

- Perform a full range of partitioning, enrichment, chunking, and embedding of your files and data.
- Batch-process files locally, and batch-process files and data that are stored in remote storage locations, databases, and vector stores.
- Retrieve batch-processed local file results locally as well, and send batch-processed remote file or data results to remote storage locations, databases, and vector stores.
- Use the latest and highest-performing models.
