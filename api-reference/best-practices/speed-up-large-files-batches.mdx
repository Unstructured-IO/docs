title: Speed up processing of large files and batches
---

When you use Unstructued API services, here are some techniques that you can try to help speed up the processing or large files and large batches of files.

## Adding processors

For speeding up file processing during [ingestion](), the Unstructured CLI and Unstructured Python Ingest enable you to instruct Unstructured to use additional processing resources:

For the Unstructured CLI, set `--num-processes` to the number of ..., for example:

```bash
unstructured-ingest \
  local \
    --num-processes 2
    # ...
```

For Unstructured Python Ingest, set the `ProcessorConfig` object's `num_processes` parameter to the number of ..., for example:

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python Ingest v2
    from unstructured.ingest.v2.interfaces import ProcessorConfig

    # ...

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        Pipeline.from_configs(
            context=ProcessorConfig(
                num_processes=2,
                # ...  
            ),
            # ...
        ).run()
    ```

    ```python Python Ingest v1
    from unstructured.ingest.interfaces import (
        ProcessorConfig,
        # ...
    )
    from unstructured.ingest.runner import LocalRunner

    # ...

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        runner = LocalRunner(
            processor_config=ProcessorConfig(
                num_processes=2,
                # ...
            ),
            # ...
        ).run()
    ```
</CodeGroup>

## PDF files

To speed up PDF file processing, the [Unstructured SDKs for Python and JavaScript/TypeScript](/api-reference/api-services/sdk) provide the following parameters to help speed up processing a large PDF file:

- `split_pdf_page` (Python) or `splitPdfPage` (JavaScript/TypeScript), when set to true, splits the PDF file on the client side before sending it as batches to Unstructured for processing. The number of pages in each batch is determined internally. Batches can contain between 2 and 20 pages.
- `split_pdf_concurrency_level` (Python) or `splitPdfConcurrencyLevel` (JavaScript/TypeScript) is an integer that specifies the number of parallel requests. The default is 5. The maximum is 15. This behavior is ignored unless `split_pdf_page` (Python) or `splitPdfPage` (JavaScript/TypeScript) is also set to true.
- `split_pdf_page_range` (Python only) is a list of two integers that specify the beginning and ending page numbers of the PDF file to be sent. A `ValueError` is raised if the specified range is not valid. This behavior is ignored unless `split_pdf_page` is also set to true.
